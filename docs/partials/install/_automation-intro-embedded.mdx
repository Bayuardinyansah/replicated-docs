You can use Replicated kURL to provision a cluster and install an application on a VM or bare metal server. When you use the kots CLI to install an application in a kURL cluster, you first run the kURL installation script to provision the cluster and automatically install KOTS in the cluster. Then, you can run the `kots install` command to install the application.
