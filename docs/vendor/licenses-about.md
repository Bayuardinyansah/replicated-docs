# About Customers

This topic provides an overview of customer licenses, including information about license types, the **Customers** page in the vendor portal, and how Replicated uses the customer entitlement information that you provide in license files.

## Overview of Customer Licenses

Each customer that you create in the Replicated vendor portal has a unique license
file. The customer uploads this license file to the Replicated admin console when
they install or update your application.

They can also update, or _sync_, the license file from the admin console. For more
information, see [Updating licenses](../enterprise/updating-licenses) in the _Enterprise_
documentation.

Each customer license includes several fields that uniquely identify the customer
and the application, specify the release channel, and define the _entitlement information_
about the customer.

Entitlement information describes the details of the license, such as if the license
has an expiration date.

Replicated securely delivers these entitlements to the application and makes them
available in the Kubernetes manifest files or at runtime using the Replicated admin
console API.

### License Types

Each customer license includes a `license_type` field. The type of customer defined
by the `license_type` field is used solely for reporting purposes. A customer's
access to your application is not affected by the type that you assign.

The possible values for the `license_type` field are development, trial, paid, and
community. For more information about each type, see [About Customer License Types](licenses-about-types).
### Built-in and Custom License Fields

Each customer license file has several built-in fields. Built-in fields are reserved
field names. You can specify the values for these fields to define entitlements
for the customer.

For example, there are built-in license fields that define the license expiration
date, the customer name, the application slug value, and whether air gap installations
are supported.

For more information about built-in fields, see [About Built-in License Fields](licenses-using-builtin-fields).

You can also create custom license fields. Custom license fields are useful when
there are entitlements specific to the customer.

For example, you can create a custom license field to limit the number of active
users permitted. Or, you can create a field that specifies the domain on which
the customer can run the application.

For more information about creating custom license fields, see [Managing Custom License Fields](licenses-adding-custom-fields)
and [Referencing Custom License Fields](licenses-referencing-fields).

### License Expiration Handling

The built-in `expires_at` license field defines the expiration date for a customer license. When you set an expiration date in the vendor portal, the `expires_at` field is set to midnight UTC on the date selected.

By default, an application with an expired license continues to run, but is prevented from receiving updates. To change the behavior of your application when a license expires, you can can add custom logic based on the values for the `expires_at` field.

### License Archival

When you archive a license in the vendor portal, it is hidden in the default license
search and becomes read-only. Archival does not affect the utility of license files
downloaded before the change.

To expire a license, set an expiration date and policy before archiving.
This is a convenience feature for how licenses are displayed in the vendor portal.

## About the Customers Page

The Replicated vendor portal **Customers** page displays details about each customer license that you create, including the channel the customer is assigned, the type of license, the number of active application instances installed with the license, and more.

The following shows an example of the **Customers** page:

From the **Customers** page, you can do the following:
<!-- * View insights about the adoption rate of each version of your application across your customers. For more information, see [Adoption Rate (Beta)](customer-adoption). -->
* Create new customers
* Download a CSV file with details about each customer
* Click the **Manage customer** button to edit details such as the customer name and email, the custom license fields assigned to the customer, and the license expiration policy.
* Download the license file for each customer
* Click the **Customer reporting** button to view data about the active application instances associated with each customer. For more information, see [Customer Reporting](customer-reporting).
