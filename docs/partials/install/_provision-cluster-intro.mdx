This procedure describes how to use the Kubernetes installer to provision a cluster in a VM or bare metal server. When you create a cluster with the Kubernetes installer, the Kubernetes installer automatically installs the Replicated app manager in the cluster. The app manager deploys the Replicated admin console, which provides a user interface for installing and managing the application instance.
