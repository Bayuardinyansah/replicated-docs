# Semantic Versioning

Semantic versioning is available with the Replicated app manager v1.58.0 and later.

When you enable semantic versioning on a channel in the vendor portal, the Replicated admin console uses the semantic version format to sequence releases assigned to the channel.

For more information, see [Enabling Semantic Versioning](releases-semantic-versioning).
