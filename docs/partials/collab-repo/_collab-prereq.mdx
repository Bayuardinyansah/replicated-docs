Your team must have a replicated-collab repository configured to add users to
the repository and to manage repository access through the vendor portal. To get 
a collab support repository configured in GitHub for your team, complete the onboarding 
instructions in the email you received from Replicated. You can also access [Replicated community help forum](https://community.replicated.com/) for assistance.
