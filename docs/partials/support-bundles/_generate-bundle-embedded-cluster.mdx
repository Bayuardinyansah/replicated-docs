From the shell, you can generate a support bundle for the Embedded Cluster to help with troubleshooting.

The support bundle collects host-level information to troubleshoot failures related to host configuration like DNS, networking, or storage problems. It also collects cluster-level information about the components provided by Replicated, such as the Admin Console and Embedded Cluster operator that manage install and upgrade operations.

If the cluster hasn't installed successfully and cluster-level information is not available, it will be excluded from the bundle.

To generate a support bundle:

1. Access the Embedded Cluster shell:

   ```bash
   sudo ./APP_SLUG shell
   ```
   Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug for the application.

2. Generate the support bundle:

   ```bash
   kubectl support-bundle /var/lib/embedded-cluster/support/host-support-bundle.yaml --load-cluster-specs
   ```
