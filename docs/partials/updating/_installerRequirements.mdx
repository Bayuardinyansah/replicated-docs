* Replicated recommends that you use the same flags with the installation script that you have used previously. For a complete list of the available installation flags, see [Advanced Options](https://kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/advanced-options) in the kURL documentation.
* If you used the `installer-spec-file` flag to pass a `patch.yaml` file when you ran the installation script previously, you must include the `installer-spec-file` flag with the same `patch.yaml` file when you re-run the installation script.

   If you do not include a `patch.yaml` file, then the installation script uses the Kubernetes installer specification from the application vendor to update your cluster. The specification from the vendor would overwrite any configuration that you provided previously in a `patch.yaml` file, resulting in changes to the add-ons in your cluster. 

   **Example**

   ```
   curl https://kurl.sh/latest | sudo bash -s installer-spec-file="./patch.yaml"
   ```

* By default, the KOTS add-on in the Kubernetes installer specification also upgrades your application to the latest version when you run the installation script.

    To prevent the KOTS add-on from automatically upgrading the version of your application, you must include the `app-version-label` flag, and set the flag to the desired version of the application. For example, to continue using the same application version, set the `app-version-label` flag to the currently installed application version.

    **Example**

    ```
    curl https://kurl.sh/latest | sudo bash -s app-version-label=1.5.0  
    ```
