You can add custom license entitlements for your application in the Vendor Portal. Custom license fields are useful when there is entitlement information that applies to a subset of customers. For example, you can create a custom license field to limit the number of active users permitted. Or, you can create a field that limits the number of nodes a customer is permitted on their cluster.

After you add custom entitlements, you can also add logic to your application to query license entitlements both before deployment and at runtime.
