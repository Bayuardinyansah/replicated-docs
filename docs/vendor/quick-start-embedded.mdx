# Embedded Cluster Quick Start

Welcome! This topic provides a quick start workflow to help you get started with Replicated KOTS and the Replicated Embedded Cluster installer.

## Objectives

The goals of this quick start are to introduce new Replicated users to the following common tasks:
* Working with applications, channels, releases, and customers in the Replicated Vendor Portal and Replicated CLI
* Testing and iterating on releases by installing in a development environment

Understanding these tasks will help you when you begin the process of onboarding your application to the Replicated Platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, complete the following prerequisites:

* This workflow assumes that you have a Helm chart that you can install and develop against. Replicated strongly recommends that all vendors distribute their application as a Helm chart because many enterprise users expect to be able to install using Helm.

  You can use your own application chart or a sample chart. If you want to use a sample chart, Replicated recommends that you run the following Helm CLI command to create a new `replicated-onboarding` folder with a basic NGINX deployment:
  ```bash
  helm create replicated-onboarding
  ``` 
  For more information, see [Helm Create](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_create/) in the Helm documentation.
  
  Alternatively, more advanced users can also use one of the following open source Helm charts:
    * [Gitea](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/gitea)

       ```
       helm pull --untar oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/gitea
       ```

    * [MediaWiki](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/mediawiki) 

       ```
       helm pull --untar oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/mediawiki
       ```

    * [WordPress](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/wordpress)

       ```
       helm pull --untar oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/wordpress
       ``` 

  :::note
  If you do not intend to distribute a Helm chart-based application with Replicated, see [KOTS Tutorial (UI)](tutorial-ui-setup) to follow an onboarding workflow that uses a sample application with standard Kubernetes manifests and demonstrates installing with Replicated KOTS.
  ::: 

* Install the Replicated CLI.

* Prepare your development environment by ensuring you have access to a VM where you can test the installation and upgrade processes for Embedded Cluster.

## Quick Start Workflow

To get started with KOTS and Embedded Cluster:

1. Create an account in the Vendor Portal. You can either create a new team or join an existing team. For more information, see [Creating a Vendor Account](vendor-portal-creating-account).

1. Create a new application:

   1. In the [Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com/), from the application drop down, click **Create new app..**.

   1. In the **Name your application** field, enter a name. For example, "Wordpress Test" or "MediaWiki Onboarding".

1. Package the Helm chart with the SDK:

   1. In the Helm chart `Chart.yaml`, add the Replicated SDK as a dependency:

      <DependencyYaml/>

      The Replicated SDK is a Helm chart that provides access to Replicated features and can be installed as a small service alongside your application. For more information, see [About the Replicated SDK](/vendor/replicated-sdk-overview).

   1. Update dependencies and package the chart as a `.tgz` file:

      <HelmPackage/>

1. Create a release:

1. Create a customer so that you can install the release:

    1. Click **Customer > Create customer**.

    1. For **Customer name**, add a name.

    1. For **Channel**, select Unstable. This allows the customer to install releases promoted to the Unstable channel.

    1. For **Customer email**, enter an email address. An email address is required for Helm installations to authenticate with the Replicated registry. This email address is never used to send emails to customers.

    1. Click **Save Changes**.

    For more information, see Creating and Managing Customers.

1. Install the application with Embedded Cluster:
     
    1. On the page for the customer that you created, click **Install instructions > Helm**.
