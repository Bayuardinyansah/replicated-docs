# Generating Support Bundles for KOTS Installations

This topic describes how to generate support bundles for applications that were installed with Replicated KOTS.

## Generate a Bundle from the Admin Console

<GenerateBundleAdminConsole/>

## Generate a Bundle Using the CLI

You can generate a support bundle using the support-bundle CLI instead of the Admin Console. For example, you might need to generate a bundle from the CLI if the Admin Console is not available. Or perhaps you need to use a more recent version of the support-bundle plugin than what is embedded in the Admin Console.
