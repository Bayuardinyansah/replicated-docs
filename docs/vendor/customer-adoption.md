The **Adoption Report** section is in Beta and is labeled as such in the vendor portal. The character of this data, how it is computed, and how it is displayed is subject to change.

## About Adoption Rate

The **Adoption** section on the **Customers** page provides insights about the rate at which your customers upgrade their instances and adopt the latest versions of your application. As an application vendor, you can use these adoption rate metrics to learn if your customers are completing upgrades regularly, which is a key indicator of the discoverability and ease of application upgrades.

The vendor portal generates adoption rate data from all your customer's application instances that have checked-in during the selected time period. For more information about instance check-ins, see [How the Vendor Portal Collects Instance Data](instance-insights-event-data#about-reporting) in _About Instance and Event Data_.

The following screenshot shows an example of the **Adoption** report:

As shown in the screenshot above, the **Adoption** report includes a graph and key adoption rate metrics. For more information about how to interpret this data, see [Adoption Graph](#graph) and [Adoption Metrics](#metrics) below.

The **Adoption** report also displays the number of customers assigned to the selected channel and a link to the report that you can share with other members of your team.

You can filter the graph and metrics in the **Adoption** report by:
* License type (Paid, Trial, Dev, or Community)
* Time period (the previous month, three months, six months, or twelve months)
* Release channel where the instance license is assigned, such as Stable or Beta

## Adoption Graph {#graph}

The **Adoption** report includes a graph that shows the percent of active instances that are running different versions of your application within the selected time period.

The following shows an example of an adoption rate graph with three months of data:

As shown in the image above, the graph plots the number of active instances in each week in the selected time period. Additionally, the graph uses colors to represent the application versions that were active in each week. The key to the left of the graph shows the unique color that is assigned to each application version. You can use this color-coding to see at a glance the percent of active instances that were running different versions of your application across the selected time period.

You can also hover over a color-coded section in the graph to view the number and percentage of active instances that were running the version in a given period.

If there are no active instances of your application, then the adoption rate graph displays a "No Instances" message.

## Adoption Metrics {#metrics}

The **Adoption** section includes metrics that show how frequently your customers discover and complete upgrades to new versions of your application. It is important that your users adopt new versions of your application so that they have access to the latest features and bug fixes. Additionally, when most of your users are on the latest versions, you can also reduce the number of versions for which you provide support and maintain documentation.

The following shows an example of the metrics in the **Adoption rate** section:

As shown in the image above, the **Adoption rate** section displays the following metrics:
* Instances on last three versions
* Unique versions
* Median relative age
* Upgrades completed

Based on the time period selected, each metric includes an arrow that shows the change in value compared to the previous period. For example, if the median relative age today is 68 days, the selected time period is three months, and three months ago the median relative age was 55 days, then the metric would show an upward-facing arrow with an increase of 13 days. 

The following table describes each metric in the **Adoption rate** section, including the formula used to calculate its value and the recommended trend for the metric over time:

        <p>The instance does <em>not</em> need to become available (as indicated by reaching a Ready state) after deploying the new version for the upgrade to be counted as complete.</p>
