# Create a Customer

To create a customer so that you can install the release in your cluster:

1. Click **Customer > Create customer**.

1. For **Customer name**, add a name.

1. For **Channel**, select **Unstable**. This allows the customer to install releases promoted to the Unstable channel.

1. For **Customer email**, enter an email address. An email address is required for Helm installations to authenticate with the Replicated registry. This email address is never used to send emails to customers.

1. Click **Save Changes**.
