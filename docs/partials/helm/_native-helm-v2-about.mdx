With native Helm v2, KOTS deploys your Helm chart using `helm install` or `helm upgrade`. Unlike native Helm v1, KOTS does not modify the chart with Kustomize. Native Helm v2 results in Helm installations that can be reproduced outside of KOTS. Additionally, because the chart is deployed with Helm directly, it enables the use of additional Helm functionality that was not available with native Helm v1.
