When you update an existing RBAC policy to add one or more of the following resources, the GitHub role in the Replicated collab repository of every team member that is assigned to that policy and has a GitHub username saved in their account is updated accordingly:
  * `team/support-issues/read`
  * `team/support-issues/write`
  * `team/support-issues/triage`
  * `team/support-issues/admin`
