# Generating Support Bundles

For Helm charts and KOTS installations, support bundles can be generated using these CLI commands.

:::note
For KOTS, using the admin console and additional CLI options are available. For more information, see [Generating Support Bundles](https://docs.replicated.com/enterprise/troubleshooting-an-app) in the KOTS documentation.

## Prerequisite

<InstallPlugin/>


## Generate a Bundle

These methods are supported for Helm charts and for KOTS version 1.94.2 and later. For automatic discovery, Helm charts must use Secrets or ConfigMaps with the label `troubleshoot.sh/kind: support-bundle`.

## Generate a Support Bundle when a Helm Installation Fails

If an installation fails and you want to collect a support bundle to assist with diagnostics, you can use a Replicated default specification to generate the support bundle.

Run the following command:

```
kubectl support-bundle https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot-specs/main/in-cluster/default.yaml
```
