# Generating Support Bundles

The Replicated KOTS Admin Console includes a Troubleshoot page where you can generate an analysis and review remediation suggestions for troubleshooting an application. You can download a support bundle to share with your vendor.

Alternatively, you can generate a support bundle using the support-bundle CLI. For embedded clusters created with Replicated kURL, you can also generate a host support bundle.

## Generating a Support Bundle using the CLI

You can generate a support bundle using the support-bundle CLI instead of the Admin Console. For example, the Admin Console might not be available if you are using a Replicated kURL installer and the installation fails. Or perhaps you need to use a more recent version of the support-bundle plugin than what is embedded in the Admin Console.
