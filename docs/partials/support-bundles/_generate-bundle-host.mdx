For embedded clusters created with kURL, you can generate a host support bundle. Use this method when:

- A cluster is down
- The application is not installed
- The Replicated Admin Console is not working
- To debug a host-specific performance and configuration problems even when the cluster is running

Your vendor typically provides a host support bundle YAML file that you run with a command to generate the host support bundle. You can also create a your own host support bundle YAML file. For more information about creating a YAML file, see [All Host Collectors and Analyzers](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/host-collect-analyze/all/) in the Troubleshoot documentation.

If you want to use a default YAML file from the Troubleshoot.sh repository for troubleshooting a degraded cluster, follow the command in the steps below.

Root access is typically not required to run the host collectors and analyzers. However, depending on what is being collected, you might need to run the support-bundle binary with elevated permissions. For example, if you run the `filesystemPerformance` host collector against `/var/lib/etcd` and the user running the binary does not have permissions on this directory, the collection process fails.

To generate a host support bundle:

1. Do one of the following:

    - Save the host support bundle YAML file on the host.

    - Run the following command to download a host support bundle YAML file from the Troubleshoot repository that can help troubleshoot a degraded embedded kURL cluster:

      ```
      kubectl support-bundle https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot-specs/main/host/default.yaml
      ```

   :::note
   For air gap environments, download the YAML file and copy it to the air gap machine.
   :::

1. Run the following command on the host to generate a host support bundle:

   ```
   ./support-bundle --interactive=false PATH/FILE.yaml
   ```

   Replace:
     - `PATH` with the path to the host support bundle YAML file.
     - `FILE` with the name of the host support bundle YAML file from your vendor.

1. Share the host support bundle with your vendor's support team, if needed.

1. Repeat these steps for each node because there is no method to generate host support bundles on remote hosts. If you have a multi-node embedded kURL cluster, you must run the support-bundle binary on each node and generate a host support bundle for each node.
