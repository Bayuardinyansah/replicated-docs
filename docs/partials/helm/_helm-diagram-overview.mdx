As shown in the diagram above, when a release containing one or more Helm charts is promoted to a channel in the Replicated vendor portal, the vendor portal automatically extracts any Helm charts included in the release. These charts are pushed as OCI objects to the Replicated registry. The Replicated registry is a private image registry hosted by Replicated at `registry.replicated.com`. For information about security for the Replicated registry, see [Replicated Private Registry Security](packaging-private-registry-security).

For example, if your application in the vendor portal is named My App and you promote a release containing a Helm chart with `name: my-chart` to the Beta channel, then the vendor portal pushes the chart to the following location: `oci://registry.replicated.com/app/beta/my-chart`.

Customers can install your Helm chart by first logging in to the Replicated registry with their unique license ID. This step ensures that any customer who pulls your chart from the registry has a valid, unexpired license. After the customer pulls your Helm chart from the Replicated registry, they can run `helm install`.
