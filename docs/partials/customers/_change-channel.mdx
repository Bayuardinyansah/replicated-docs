You can change the channel that a customer is assigned at any time. When you change the channel assigned to an existing customer, the customer can sync their license in the Replicated admin console to view the new release available to them for upgrade. After the customer syncs their license, the admin console always fetches the latest release on the new channel, regardless of the presence of any releases on the channel that are marked as required.
