The compatibility matrix can create clusters on virtual machines (VMs), such as kind, k3s, and Red Hat OpenShift OKD, and also create cloud-managed clusters, such as EKS and GKE:

* Cloud-based Kubernetes distributions are run in a Replicated managed and controlled cloud account to optimize and deliver a clusters quickly and reliably. The Replicated account has control planes ready and adds a node group when you request it, making the cluster available much faster than if you try to create your own cluster with your own cloud account.

* VMs run on Replicated bare metal servers located in several data centers, including data centers physically in the European Union.

To view the most up-to-date list of the Kubernetes cluster distributions and versions that can be created with the compatibility matrix, run [`replicated cluster versions`](/reference/replicated-cli-cluster-versions).
