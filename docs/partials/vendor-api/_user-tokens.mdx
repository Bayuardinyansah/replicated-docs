User API tokens are private to the user creating the token. User tokens assume the user's account when used, including any RBAC permissions.

Names for user API tokens must be unique per user.

User API tokens are only displayed  at the time they are created. The token cannot be retrieved again after the initial creation. 

Updates to a user's RBAC role are applied to all of the tokens belonging to that user.

Revoking a user token immediately invalidates that token. When a user account is deleted, its user tokens are also deleted.
