# Step 4: Create a Release

Now that you have some YAML manifest files, you can create a release and promote it to the `Unstable` channel for internal testing.

To create and promote a release:

1. Run the following command with the `--auto` flag to generate release notes and metadata based on the git status.

  ```shell script
  $ replicated release create --auto
  ```

  **Example output:**

  ```text
      • Reading Environment ✓

    Prepared to create release with defaults:

        yaml-dir        "./manifests"
        promote         "Unstable"
        version         "Unstable-ba710e5"
        release-notes   "CLI release of master triggered by dex [SHA: ba710e5] [28 Sep 20 09:15 CDT]"
        ensure-channel  true

    Create with these properties? [Y/n]
  ```

1. Press Enter to confirm the prompt. The release is created and promoted.

  **Example output:**

  ```text
    • Reading manifests from ./manifests ✓
    • Creating Release ✓
      • SEQUENCE: 1
    • Promoting ✓
      • Channel VEr0nhJBBUdaWpPvOIK-SOryKZEwa3Mg successfully set to release 1
  ```

1. Run the following command to verify that the release was created:

  ```text
  $ replicated release ls
  ```
  **Example output:**

  ```text
  SEQUENCE    CREATED                      EDITED                  ACTIVE_CHANNELS
  1           2020-09-03T11:48:45-07:00    0001-01-01T00:00:00Z    Unstable
  ```
