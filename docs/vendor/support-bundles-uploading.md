# Submitting a Support Request with a Support Bundle

Support bundles help the Replicated support team troubleshoot your application faster. The Replicated vendor portal lets you open a support request and upload the bundle securely.

If you or your customer are unable to generate a support bundle, you can still submit the request and the support team will assist you. For more information about how to generate a support bundle, see [Troubleshooting an application](https://docs.replicated.com/enterprise/troubleshooting-an-app).

To open a support request and upload the support bundle:

1. From the vendor portal, select **Troubleshoot > Upload a support bundle**.

  The Analyze a support bundle dialog opens.

1. Drag and drop the bundle or click **choose a file to upload** and select the file from the file browser that opens.

1. Click **Upload support bundle**.

  The Support bundle analysis page opens, showing the Analysis overview and File inspector tabs. This information helps you examine the bundle and determine whether you can fix the issue or need help from the Replicated support team.

1. To open a support issue, click **Submit a support ticket**.
