# Step 5: Create a Customer

After promoting the first release for the `cli-tutorial` application, you create a customer. A customer represents a single licensed end user of your application.

When you install the application later in this tutorial, you will upload the license file. The license defines entitlement information for the customer, and allows the Replicated admin console to create the application containers.

To create a customer license:

1. Run the following command to create a customer named `Some-Big-Bank` that is assigned to the Unstable channel:

  ```
  replicated customer create \
    --name "Some-Big-Bank" \
    --expires-in "240h" \
    --channel "Unstable"
  ```
  The Unstable channel is the channel where you promoted the release in [Step 4: Create a Release](tutorial-cli-create-release). Assigning the customer to a channel allows them to install the releases that are promoted to that channel.

  **Example output:**

  ```
  ID                             NAME             CHANNELS     EXPIRES                          TYPE
  2GuB3VYLjU5t9vNDK6byjgiTKUs    Some-Big-Bank    Unstable     2022-11-10 14:59:49 +0000 UTC    dev
  ```

1. Verify the customer creation details:

  ```
  replicated customer ls
  ```

  **Example output:**

  ```
  ID                             NAME             CHANNELS     EXPIRES                          TYPE
  2GuB3VYLjU5t9vNDK6byjgiTKUs    Some-Big-Bank    Unstable     2022-11-10 14:59:49 +0000 UTC    dev
  ```

1. Run the following command to download the license file for the customer that you just created:

  ```
  replicated customer download-license \
    --customer "Some-Big-Bank"
  ```

  The license downloads to `stdout`.

  **Example output**:

  ```
  apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
  kind: License
  metadata:
    name: some-big-bank
  spec:
    appSlug: cli-tutorial
    channelID: 2GmYFUFzj8JOSLYw0jAKKJKFua8
    channelName: Unstable
    customerName: Some-Big-Bank
    endpoint: https://replicated.app
    entitlements:
      expires_at:
        description: License Expiration
        title: Expiration
        value: "2022-11-10T14:59:49Z"
        valueType: String
    isNewKotsUiEnabled: true
    licenseID: 2GuB3ZLQsU38F5SX3n03x8qBzeL
    licenseSequence: 1
    licenseType: dev
    signature: eyJsaW...
  ```

1. Run the following command to rename the license file and save it to your Desktop:

  ```
  export LICENSE_FILE=~/Desktop/Some-Big-Bank-${REPLICATED_APP}-license.yaml
  replicated customer download-license --customer "Some-Big-Bank" > "${LICENSE_FILE}"
  ```

1. Verify that the license was written properly using either `cat` or `head`:

  ```
  head ${LICENSE_FILE}
  ```
  **Example output*:
  ```
  apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
  kind: License
  metadata:
    name: some-big-bank
  spec:
    appSlug: cli-tutorial
    channelID: 2GmYFUFzj8JOSLYw0jAKKJKFua8
    channelName: Unstable
    customerName: Some-Big-Bank
    endpoint: https://replicated.app
  ```
