1. For the first release of an application, drag and drop your application files into the file directory in the YAML editor.

  If you are editing a draft or an existing non-promoted release, the files appear in the YAML editor. You can drag and drop new manifest files as needed.

  You can also click the plus icon to add a new, untitled YAML file.
