The `optionalValues` array supports advanced use cases where value overwrites must be dependent on a given condition evaluating to true.

Not all Helm charts treat `""` and missing as the same value. If you need to have a value set that is always optional, and an empty string does not provide the same functionality as "not set", use the `optionalValues` key.
