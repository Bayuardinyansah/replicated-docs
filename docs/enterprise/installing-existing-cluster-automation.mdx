# Installing with the CLI

This topic describes how to use the Replicated kots CLI to install an application.

## Overview

You can use the kots CLI to install an application rather than using the KOTS admin console UI. In a CLI installation, you provide all the necessary artifacts to configure and install the application with the `kots install` command. For example, rather than uploading your license file in the admin console, you provide your license file with the `kots install` command using the `--license-file` flag. Additionally, any preflight checks defined for the application automatically run from the CLI rather than being displayed in the admin console.

The following shows an example of the output from the `kots install` command:

```bash
• Deploying Admin Console
 • Creating namespace ✓
 • Waiting for datastore to be ready ✓
• Waiting for Admin Console to be ready ✓
• Waiting for installation to complete ✓
• Waiting for preflight checks to complete ✓

• Press Ctrl+C to exit
• Go to http://localhost:8800 to access the Admin Console

• Go to http://localhost:8888 to access the application
```

One common use case for installing with the CLI is to automate installation, such as installing applications as part of CI/CD pipelines. CLI installations are supported for _online_ environments (with outbound internet access), _air gap_ environments (without outbound internet access), existing clusters, and clusters created with Replicated kURL on a VM or bare metal server.

For more information about the advanced options for the `kots install` command, see [install](/reference/kots-cli-install) in the kots CLI documentation.

For a tutorial that demonstrates how to install a sample application using the kots CLI, see [KOTS Tutorial (CLI)](/vendor/tutorial-cli-setup).

## Prerequisite

Create a ConfigValues file to define the configuration settings for the application. For air gap environments, ensure that you can access the ConfigValues file that you create from your installation environment.

**Example:**

<ConfigValuesExample/>

As shown in the example above, the ConfigValues file includes the names of the configuration fields for the application along with a user-supplied `value` for each field.

The ConfigValues file is specific to the application. For more information, see [Sharing a ConfigValues File](/vendor/releases-configvalues).
   
## Install

This section provides the steps for installing an application with the kots CLI in different types of environments.

### Existing Cluster

To install in an existing cluster:

1. <InstallKotsCli/>

1. Install the application:

    ```bash 
    kubectl kots install APP_NAME \
      --shared-password PASSWORD \
      --license-file PATH_TO_LICENSE \
      --config-values PATH_TO_CONFIGVALUES \
      --namespace NAMESPACE \
      --no-port-forward
    ```
    Replace:

    <PlaceholdersGlobal/>

    <PlaceholderNamespaceExisting/>

### kURL Cluster

<IntroEmbedded/>

To install with kURL on a VM or bare metal server:

1. Create the kURL cluster:

   ```
   curl -sSL https://k8s.kurl.sh/APP_NAME | sudo bash
   ```

1. Install the application in the cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl kots install APP_NAME \
      --shared-password PASSWORD \
      --license-file PATH_TO_LICENSE \
      --config-values PATH_TO_CONFIGVALUES \
      --namespace default \
      --no-port-forward
    ```

    Replace:

    <PlaceholdersGlobal/>

    <PlaceholderNamespaceEmbedded/>

### Air Gap Existing Cluster 

Air gap installations in existing clusters require the application `.airgap` bundle and the `kotsadm.tar.gz` air gap bundle. Additionally, images for the application and the KOTS admin console must be pushed to a local private registry.

To install in an air gap existing cluster:

1. Install the kots CLI. See [Manually Download and Install](/reference/kots-cli-getting-started#manually-download-and-install) in _Installing the kots CLI_.

1. <DownloadKotsBundle/>

    :::note
    The version of the `kotsadm.tar.gz` bundle must match the version of the kots CLI. You can check the version of the kots CLI with `kubectl kots version`.
    :::

1. <PushKotsImages/>

1. Install the application:

      ```bash
      kubectl kots install APP_NAME \
        --shared-password PASSWORD \
        --license-file PATH_TO_LICENSE \
        --config-values PATH_TO_CONFIGVALUES \
        --airgap-bundle PATH_TO_AIRGAP_BUNDLE \
        --namespace NAMESPACE \
        --kotsadm-registry REGISTRY_HOST \
        --registry-username RO_USERNAME \
        --registry-password RO_PASSWORD \
        --no-port-forward
      ```

      Replace:

      <PlaceholdersGlobal/>
      
      <PlaceholderAirgapBundle/>
      
      <PlaceholderNamespaceExisting/>
      
      * `REGISTRY_HOST` with the hostname for the private registry where you pushed the images.
      
      * `RO_USERNAME` and `RO_PASSWORD` with the username and password for an account that has read-only access to the private image registry.

         :::note
         KOTS stores these read-only credentials in a Kubernetes secret in the same namespace where the admin console is installed.

         KOTS uses these credentials to pull the images. To allow KOTS to pull images, the credentials are automatically created as an imagePullSecret on all of the admin console Pods.
         :::

### Air Gap kURL Cluster

<IntroEmbedded/>

Air gap installations with kURL require the application `.airgap` bundle and the kURL `.tar.gz` air gap bundle.

To install in an air gap kURL cluster on a VM or bare metal server:

1. Download the kURL `.tar.gz` air gap bundle:

   <DownloadkURLBundle/>

   For more information, see [Download the kURL Bundle](/vendor/releases-download-airgap-bundles#installer-bundle) in _Downloading Air Gap Bundles_.

1. <ExtractKurlBundle/>

1. Create the kURL cluster:

   ```
   cat install.sh | sudo bash -s airgap
   ```

1. Install the application:

    ```bash
    kubectl kots install APP_NAME \
      --shared-password PASSWORD \
      --license-file PATH_TO_LICENSE \
      --config-values PATH_TO_CONFIGVALUES \
      --airgap-bundle PATH_TO_AIRGAP_BUNDLE \
      --namespace default \
      --no-port-forward
    ```

    Replace:

    <PlaceholdersGlobal/>

    <PlaceholderAirgapBundle/>

    <PlaceholderNamespaceEmbedded/>

## (Optional) Access the Admin Console

When you install an application in an existing cluster or when you provision a cluster with the kURL installer, you also install KOTS in the cluster. KOTS deploys the admin console. The admin console is a user interface where you can manage and upgrade your application instances.

By default, during installation, KOTS automatically opens localhost port 8800 to provide access to the admin console. The `--no-port-forward` flag in the `kots install` command prevents KOTS from creating a port forward to the admin console.

After you install with the `--no-port-forward` flag, you can optionally create a port forward so that you can log in to the admin console in a browser window.

To access the admin console:

1. If you installed in a VM where you cannot open a browser window, forward a port on your local machine to `localhost:8800` on the remote VM using the SSH client:

   ```bash
   ssh -L LOCAL_PORT:localhost:8800 USERNAME@IP_ADDRESS
   ```
   Replace:
    * `LOCAL_PORT` with the port on your local machine to forward. For example, `9900` or `8800`.
    * `USERNAME` with your username for the VM.
    * `IP_ADDRESS` with the IP address for the VM.

   **Example**:

   The following example shows using the SSH client to forward port 8800 on your local machine to `localhost:8800` on the remote VM.
  
   ```bash
   ssh -L 8800:localhost:8800 user@ip-addr
   ```

1. Run the following kots CLI command to open localhost port 8800, which forwards to the admin console service:

   ```bash
   kubectl kots admin-console --namespace NAMESPACE
   ```
   Replace `NAMESPACE` with the namespace where the admin console was installed.

   For more information about the `kots admin-console` command, see [admin-console](/reference/kots-cli-admin-console-index) in the _kots CLI_ documentation.

1. Open a browser window and go to `https://localhost:8800`.

1. Log in to the admin console using the password that you created as part of the `kots install` command.
