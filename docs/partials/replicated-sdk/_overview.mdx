The Replicated SDK is a Helm chart that can be installed as a small service alongside your application. The SDK can be installed alongside Helm chart- or standard manifest-based applications using the Helm CLI or KOTS.

For information about how to distribute and install the SDK with your application, see [Installing the Replicated SDK](/vendor/replicated-sdk-installing).

Replicated recommends that the SDK is distributed with all applications because it provides access to key Replicated functionality, such as:

* Automatic access to insights and operational telemetry for instances running in customer environments. For more information, see [About Instance and Event Data](/vendor/instance-insights-event-data).
* An in-cluster API that you can use to embed Replicated features into your application, including:
  * Collect custom metrics on instances running in online or air gap environments. See [Configuring Custom Metrics](/vendor/custom-metrics).
  * Check customer license entitlements at runtime, including signature verification. See [Checking Entitlements for Helm Installations (Beta)](/vendor/licenses-reference-helm) and [Verifying License Field Signatures for Helm Installations (Beta)](/vendor/licenses-verify-fields-sdk-api). 
  * Provide update checks to alert customers when new versions of your application are available for upgrade. See [Support Update Checks in Your Admin Console](/reference/replicated-sdk-apis#support-update-checks-in-your-admin-console) in _Replicated SDK API (Beta)_.
