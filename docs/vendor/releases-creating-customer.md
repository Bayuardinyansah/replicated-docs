# Creating a customer

After you promote a release, you create a customer.

Each customer that you create in the Replicated vendor portal has a unique license file. Each customer license uniquely identifies the customer and the application, specifies their release channel, and defines _entitlement information_ about the customer.

For more information about customer licenses, see [About customer licenses](licenses-about).

1. From the [vendor portal](https://vendor.replicated.com), select Customers from the left menu.

  The Create a new customer page opens.
