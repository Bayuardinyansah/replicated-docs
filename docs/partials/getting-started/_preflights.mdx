:::note
Before you begin this task, Replicated recommends that you complete the [Add Preflight Checks to a Helm Chart](/vendor/tutorial-preflight-helm-setup) tutorial to learn how to add a preflight spec to a Helm chart in a Kubernetes secret, then run the preflight checks before installation.
:::

To define preflight checks for your application:

1. In your Helm chart `templates` directory, add a Kubernetes Secret that includes a preflight spec. For more information, see [Defining Preflight Checks](/vendor/preflight-defining).

1. Update dependencies and package the chart as a `.tgz` file:

   <HelmPackage/>

1. Add the `.tgz` file to a new release. For more information, see [Managing Releases with the Vendor Portal](releases-creating-releases) or [Managing Releases with the CLI](releases-creating-cli).

1. Install the release to test your changes.

    Preflight checks run automatically during installation.

1. Continue to create and test new releases with additional preflight checks until you are ready to move on to the next task.
