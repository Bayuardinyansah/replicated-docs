# Submitting a Support Request

You can submit a support request with or without a support bundle using the Replicated vendor portal. Uploading a support bundle is secure and helps the Replicated support team troubleshoot your application faster.

If you or your customer are unable to generate a support bundle, you can submit the request without a support bundle and the support team will assist you.

For more information about how to generate a support bundle using either the Replicated admin console or the kubectl CLI, see [Troubleshooting an Application](https://docs.replicated.com/enterprise/troubleshooting-an-app).

To submit a support request:

1. From the [vendor portal](https://vendor.replicated.com), click **Support > Submit a Support Request** or go directly to the [Support page](https://vendor.replicated.com/support).

1. In section 1 of the Support Request form, complete the fields with information about your issue.

1. In section 2, do _one_ of the following actions:

    - Use your pre-selected support bundle from the pick list or select a different bundle
    - Select **Upload and attach a new support bundle** and attach a bundle from your file browser
    - Select **I'm unable to generate a support bundle**

1. Click **Submit Support Request**. The Support team will contact you.

  :::note
  Click **Back** to exit without submitting a support request.
