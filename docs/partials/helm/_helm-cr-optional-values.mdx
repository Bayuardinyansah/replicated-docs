The `optionalValues` key can be used to include optional values in the Helm chart `values.yaml` file when a given conditional statement evaluates to true.

This supports use cases in which values must be written to a Helm chart `values.yaml` file only if there is a value to apply. For example, if a customer chooses to include an optional application component in their deployment, it might be necessary to include Helm chart values related to the optional component.
