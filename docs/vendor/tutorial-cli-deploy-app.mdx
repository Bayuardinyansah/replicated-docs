# Step 7: Edit the Config Screen

After you run the installation script and deploy the application from the previous step, you can access the Replicated admin console.

This procedure shows you how to edit the Config screen for the application by logging into the admin console, which is a typical task that customers do.

To edit the Config screen application:

1. In a browser, go to `http://localhost:8800` to access the admin console.

  :::note
  You can access the admin console as long as the installation script is running. If you press Ctrl+C to exit, run `kubectl kots admin-console --namespace cli-tutorial` to access the admin console again.
  :::

1. Enter the password that you created in [Step 6: Install the App Manager](tutorial-cli-install-app-manager) to log in to the admin console.

  The admin console dashboard opens. On the admin console **Dashboard** tab, users can take various actions, including viewing the application status, opening the application, checking for application updates, syncing their license, and setting up application monitoring on the cluster with Prometheus.

1. On the Config tab, select the **Customize Text Inputs** checkbox. In the **Text Example** field, enter any text. For example, `Hello`.

   This page displays configuration settings that are specific to the application. Software vendors define the fields that are displayed on this page in the Replicated Config custom resource. For more information, see [Config](/reference/custom-resource-config) in _Reference_.

1. Click **Save config**. In the dialog that opens, click **Go to updated version**.

    The Version history tab opens.

1. Click **Deploy** for the new version. Then click **Yes, deploy** in the confirmation dialog.

1. Click **Open App** to view the application in your browser.

   Notice the text that you entered previously on the configuration page is displayed on the screen.

   :::note
   If you do not see the new text, click Refresh in your browser.
   :::

1. In your cluster, press Ctrl + C to exit the admin console. List the Pods to see the example NGINX service that you just deployed:

    ```
    kubectl get pods --namespace NAMESPACE_NAME
    ```
    Replace `NAMESPACE_NAME` with the namespace where the app manager was installed.

    **Example output:**

    ```
    NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    kotsadm-7595595bf5-pmlng   1/1     Running   0          21m
    kotsadm-minio-0            1/1     Running   0          22m
    kotsadm-rqlite-0           1/1     Running   0          22m
    nginx-667f4fc76b-8gvr9     1/1     Running   0          17m
    ```
1. Run the following command to start the admin console again:

   ```
   kubectl kots admin-console --namespace NAMESPACE_NAME
   ```
   Replace `NAMESPACE_NAME` with the namespace where the app manager was installed.

## Next Step

Continue to [Step 8: Create a New Version](tutorial-cli-create-new-version) to make a change to one of the manifest files for the `cli-tutorial` application, then use the replicated CLI to create and promote a new release.
