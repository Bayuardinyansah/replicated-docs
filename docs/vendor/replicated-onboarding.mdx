# Replicated Onboarding

Welcome! This topic provides a checklist to help you onboard to the Replicated Platform. For more information about Replicated, see [Introduction to Replicated](../intro-replicated).

## Best Practices and Recommendations

The following are Replicated's best practices and recommendations for successfully onboarding:

* Replicated recommends that all applications are packaged with Helm. If you are relatively new to Kubernetes or Helm, start with a basic tutorial. For example, see [10 Helm Tutorials to Start your Kubernetes Journey](https://jfrog.com/blog/10-helm-tutorials-to-start-your-kubernetes-journey/) or [Tutorials](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

* When integrating new Replicated features with an application, make changes in small iterations and test frequently by installing or upgrading the application in a development environment. This will help you to more easily identify issues and troubleshoot.

    For information about how to install, see:
    * [Installing with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/installing-embedded)
    * [Installing with Helm](/vendor/install-with-helm)
    * [Installing with KOTS in Existing Clusters](/enterprise/installing-existing-cluster)
    
    For information about how to perform updates, see:
    * [Performing Updates in Embedded Clusters](/enterprise/updating-embedded)
    * [Performing Updates in Existing Clusters](/enterprise/updating-app-manager)

* Create and manage releases with the Replicated CLI. For more information, see [Installing the Replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).

* Ask for help from the Replicated community. For more information, see [Get Help from the Community](#get-help-from-the-community).

* Replicated also offers labs in Instruqt that provide a hands-on introduction to working with Replicated features, without needing your own sample application or development environment. To complete one or more labs before you begin the onboarding workflow, see:
  * [Distributing Your Application with Replicated](https://play.instruqt.com/embed/replicated/tracks/distributing-with-replicated?token=em_VHOEfNnBgU3auAnN): Learn how to quickly get value from the Replicated Platform for your application.
  * [Avoiding Installation Pitfalls](https://play.instruqt.com/embed/replicated/tracks/avoiding-installation-pitfalls?token=em_gJjtIzzTTtdd5RFG): Learn how to use preflight checks to avoid common installation issues and assure your customer is installing into a supported environment.
  * [Closing the Support Information Gap](https://play.instruqt.com/embed/replicated/tracks/closing-information-gap?token=em_MO2XXCz3bAgwtEca): Learn how to use support bundles to close the information gap between your customers and your support team.

## Get Help from the Community

The [Replicated community site](https://community.replicated.com/) is a forum where Replicated team members and users can post questions and answers related to working with the Replicated Platform. It is designed to help Replicated users troubleshoot and learn more about common tasks involved with distributing, installing, observing, and supporting their application. 

Before posting in the community site, use the search to find existing knowledge base articles related to your question. If you are not able to find an existing article that addresses your question, create a new topic or add a reply to an existing topic so that a member of the Replicated community or team can respond.

To search and participate in the Replicated community, see https://community.replicated.com/.  

## Prerequisites

* Create an account in the Vendor Portal. You can either create a new team or join an existing team. For more information, see [Creating a Vendor Account](/vendor/vendor-portal-creating-account).

* Install the Replicated CLI. See [Installing the Replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).

* Create an application in the Vendor Portal. This will be the official Vendor Portal application used by your team to create and promote both internal and customer-facing releases. See [Create an Application](/vendor/vendor-portal-manage-app#create-an-application).

* Ensure that you have development environments available to test installation and upgrades with Replicated KOTS, Replicated Embedded Cluster, and Helm. For more information about the installation requirements for the Replicated installers, see [Installation Requirements](/enterprise/installing-general-requirements).

* Complete a getting started tutorial to get familiar with the process of creating, installing, and iterating on releases in the Replicated Platform using a sample Helm chart. You will use this same basic workflow throughout the onboarding process to integrate and test new features with your own application.
   * [Tutorial: Deploy a Helm Chart on a VM with Embedded Cluster](/vendor/tutorial-embedded-cluster-setup)
   * [Tutorial: Deploy a Helm Chart with KOTS and the Helm CLI](/vendor/tutorial-kots-helm-setup)

## Onboarding Checklist

This checklist includes key Replicated Platform features to integrate with your application to onboard to the Replicated Platform.
