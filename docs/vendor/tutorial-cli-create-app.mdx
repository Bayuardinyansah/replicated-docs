# Step 2: Create an Application and Token

Create an application in the vendor portal. After you create an application, create a service account token to authenticate the replicated CLI.

You can export the token as an environment variable in your shell or add it to your favorite dotfiles.

To export the environment variables:

1. Log in to the Replicated [vendor portal](https://vendor.replicated.com). [Create a new application](https://vendor.replicated.com/new-application) or use an existing application that you created previously. For this tutorial, we are using the name CLI Quickstart, although you can use any name.

1. Open the Settings page. Copy the application slug.

    ![app-slug](/images/guides/kots/cli-setup-quickstart-settings.png)

1. Run the following command using the application slug that you copied previously:

  ```shell script
  export REPLICATED_APP=cli-quickstart
  ```

1. Create a read/write capable service account token:

  ![service-account-token](/images/guides/kots/cli-setup-service-account-token.png)

1. Run the following command to export the token:

  ```shell script
  export REPLICATED_API_TOKEN=1366be611e3bf...
  ```

1. Run the following command to verify these values are set correctly:

  ```shell script
  replicated release ls
  ```

  You will likely see an empty list of releases. You will create a release later in this tutorial.

  ```text
  SEQUENCE    CREATED    EDITED    ACTIVE_CHANNELS
  ```
