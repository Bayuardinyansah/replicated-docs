Welcome! This topic describes how to get started with Replicated as a software vendor. It also includes information on how to navigate the Replicated product documentation site.

## Get Started with a Helm Chart

See [Get Started with a Helm Chart](/vendor/get-started-placeholder)

## Get Started with KOTS

The KOTS and kURL documentation includes UI-based and CLI-based tutorials that are designed to help software vendors learn about Replicated by completing common tasks with a sample application. Replicated strongly recommends that you complete both of the following tutorials before you get started implementing features with your own application:

* **Vendor Portal and Admin Console UI Tutorial**: Shows how to use the Replicated vendor portal to create and promote releases, then install with the Replicated admin console. See [Introduction and Setup](/vendor/tutorial-ui-setup) in _UI Tutorial_.
* **replicated CLI and kots CLI Tutorial**: Shows how to use the replicated CLI to create and promote releases, then install with the Replicated kots CLI. See [Introduction and Setup](/vendor/tutorial-cli-setup) in _CLI Tutorial_.
