Service accounts are assigned a token and associated with an RBAC policy. Users with the proper permissions can create, retrieve, or revoke service account tokens. Admin users can assign any RBAC policy to a service account. Non-admin users can only assign their own RBAC policy.

Service accounts are useful for operations that are not tied to a particular user, such as CI/CD or integrations.

Updates to a service account's RBAC policy are automatically applied to its associated token. When a service account is removed, its tokens are also invalidated.
