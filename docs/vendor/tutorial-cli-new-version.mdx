# Step 8: Release a New Version

From your local repo, you can update the NGINX deployment to test a simple update to the application.

To make an update:

1. Add the following line to `deployment.yaml`, right after `spec:`:

  ```yaml
    replicas: 2
  ```

1. Use `head` to view the first 10 lines of the file:

  ```shell script
  head manifests/deployment.yaml
  ```

  **Example output:**

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: example-nginx
    labels:
      app: example
      component: nginx
  spec:
    replicas: 2
    selector:
  ```

1. Run the following command to create a new release:

  ```shell script
  replicated release create --auto
  ```
