The Vendor API v3 is the API to manage applications, releases, customers, licenses, and everything related to an application managed by the Replicated vendor portal.

The replicated CLI is an implementation of the Vendor API v3.

Using the replicated CLI and Vendor API V3 requires an API token for authorization. Tokens are primarily used with the Vendor API and the replicated CLI for automated customer, channel, and release management.

Tokens are created in the vendor portal.

The following types of token are available:

- [Service Accounts](#service-accounts)
- [User API Tokens](user-api-tokens)


:::note
Team API tokens are deprecated and cannot be generated. However, you can migrate to Service Accounts instead.
