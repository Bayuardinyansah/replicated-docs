In addition to the built-in insights displayed in the Vendor Portal by default (such as uptime and time to install), you can also configure custom metrics to measure instances of your application running customer environments. Custom metrics can be collected for application instances running in online or air gap environments using the Replicated SDK.

For more information, see [Configuring Custom Metrics](/vendor/custom-metrics).
