:::note
For vendors that support both KOTS and Helm CLI installations, Replicated prevents releases from being promoted to a channel if the customers assigned to the channel cannot install the release. For more information, see [Promoting KOTS-Only and Helm CLI-Only Releases](/vendor/releases-about#kots-helm-releases) in _About Channels and Releases_.
