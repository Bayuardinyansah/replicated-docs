## User Tokens

User tokens are private to the user creating the token. User tokens assume the user's account when used, including RBAC permissions.

User token names must be unique per user.

User tokens are only displayed once when created. The token cannot be retrieved again after initial creation. 

Revoking a user token will immediately invalidate that token. Additionally, deleting the user account also deletes all user tokens that belong to the user account.

Updates to a user's RBAC role are applied to the user's tokens. 

## Team Tokens

Team tokens are deprecated, but continue to function similar to Service Accounts. Team tokens are not connected to a user account lifecycle. Team tokens do not have an RBAC policy applied other than Admin or Read Only. All use cases for a team token can be replaced with a Service Account.

We recommended replacing Team Tokens with Service Accounts for automation and integrations.
