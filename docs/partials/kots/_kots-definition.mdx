Replicated KOTS is a kubectl plugin and an in-cluster admin console that provides highly successful installations of Helm charts and Kubernetes applications into customer-controlled environments, including on-prem and air gap environments. KOTS also supports installations on VMs or bare metal servers through _embedded clusters_, which are clusters built from a customized Kubernetes distribution embedded with an application and provisioned in the customer environment at the time of installation.
