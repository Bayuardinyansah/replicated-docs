To deploy Helm charts, KOTS requires a HelmChart custom resource for each Helm chart that you add to a release. You configure the HelmChart custom resource to provide the necessary instructions to KOTS for processing and preparing the chart for deployment. The HelmChart custom resource also maps to the `values.yaml` file in the Helm chart. For example, you can use the Helm chart custom resource to map the `values.yaml` file and the Replicated admin console Config page to edit values in your Helm chart based on user-provided configuration settings.
