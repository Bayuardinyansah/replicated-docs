# Managing Releases with the CLI

This topic describes how to use the replicated CLI to create and promote releases.

For information about creating and managing releases with the vendor portal, see [Managing Releases with the Vendor Portal](/vendor/releases-creating-releases).

For information about creating and managing releases with the Vendor API v3, see the [releases](https://replicated-vendor-api.readme.io/reference/createrelease) section in the Vendor API v3 documentation.

## Prerequisites

Before you create a release using the replicated CLI, complete the following prerequisites:

* Install the replicated CLI. See [Installing the replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).
  
* Create a new application using the `replicated app create APP_NAME` command. You only need to do this procedure one time for each application that you want to deploy. See [`app create`](/reference/replicated-cli-app-create) in _Reference_.

* Set the `REPLICATED_APP` and `REPLICATED_API_TOKEN` environment variables. See [Set the Environment Variables](/reference/replicated-cli-installing#set-environment-variables) in _Installing the replicated CLI_.

  **Example**:

  ```bash
  export REPLICATED_APP=my-app-slug
  export REPLICATED_API_TOKEN=1234abcd
  ```

  :::note
  The token environment variable is valid for a single session. You must export it for each new session.

## Create a Release From a Local Directory {#dir}

You can use the replicated CLI to create a release from the local directory that contains your application files.

To create and promote a new release:

1. (Helm Charts Only) If your release contains any Helm charts:

   1. For each Helm chart, package the chart and its dependencies into `.tgz` files:

      ```
      helm package . --dependency-update
      ```

      For more information, see [Helm Package](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_package/) in the Helm documentation.

   1. Move the `.tgz` file or files to the local directory with your application files:

      ```
      mv CHART_TGZ PATH_TO_APP_DIR
      ```
      Replace:
      * `CHART_TGZ` with the `.tgz` Helm chart package.
      * `PATH_TO_APP_DIR` with path to the local directory with your application files.

      **Example**

      ```
      mv wordpress-1.3.5.tgz manifests
      ```

   1. (KOTS Only) If your release supports installation with Replicated KOTS, configure a HelmChart custom resource for each Helm chart in your release and add them to the local directory with your application files. See [Configuring the HelmChart Custom Resource](helm-native-v2-using).

1. Do one of the following:

   * **Create and promote with one command**:

      ```
      replicated release create --yaml-dir PATH_TO_APP_DIR --lint --promote CHANNEL
      ```
      Replace:
      * `PATH_TO_APP_DIR` with path to the local directory with your application files.
      * `CHANNEL` with the channel ID or the case sensitive name of the channel.

   * **Create and edit before promoting**:   

      1. Lint the application manifest files and ensure that there are no errors in the YAML:

        ```bash
        replicated release lint --yaml-dir=PATH_TO_APP_DIR
        ```

        Replace `PATH_TO_APP_DIR` with path to the local directory with your application files.

        For more information about linting, see [release lint](/reference/replicated-cli-release-lint) and [Linter Rules](/reference/linter).

      1. Create a new release:

          ```bash
          replicated release create --yaml-dir PATH_TO_APP_DIR
          ```
          Replace `PATH_TO_APP_DIR` with path to the local directory with your application files.

        For more information, see [release create](/reference/replicated-cli-release-create) or [release update](/reference/replicated-cli-release-update) in _Reference_.

      1. Continue to edit and lint the release as needed, then update the release:

          ```
          replicated release update SEQUENCE --yaml-dir PATH_TO_APP_DIR
          ```
          Replace:
            
          -  `SEQUENCE` with the release sequence number. This identifies the existing release to be updated.
          -  `PATH_TO_APP_DIR` with path to the local directory with your application files.

          For more information, see [release update](/reference/replicated-cli-release-update) in _Reference_.

      1. Promote the release when you are ready to test it. Releases cannot be edited after they are promoted. To make changes after promotion, you have to create a new release.

          ```
          replicated release promote SEQUENCE CHANNEL
          ```

          Replace:
            
          -  `SEQUENCE` with the release sequence number.
          -  `CHANNEL` with the channel ID or the case sensitive name of the channel.

          For more information, see [release promote](/reference/replicated-cli-release-promote) in the replicated CLI documentation.

1. Verify that the release was promoted to the channel:

  ```
  replicated release ls
  ```

## Create a Release With a Helm Chart Only

For applications that contain only a single Helm chart, you can use the `--chart` flag to add your Helm chart to a release. This prevents you from having to create a local directory with your Helm chart to create the release.

For releases that support installation with Replicated KOTS, see [Create a Release From a Local Directory](#dir) above.

To create a release for an application that contains a Helm chart:

1. Package the chart and its dependencies into a `.tgz` file:

   ```
   helm package . --dependency-update
   ```

   For more information, see [Helm Package](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_package/) in the Helm documentation.

1. Create a release and promote it to the Unstable channel:
   
   ```bash
   replicated release create --chart=CHART_TGZ_FILE --promote=Unstable
   ```

   Replace `CHART_TGZ_FILE` with the `.tgz` Helm chart package. For example, --chart=my-chart-1.0.0.tgz.

   :::note
   As described in [Create a Release from a Local Directory](#dir) above, the `--promote` flag is optional.
   :::

1. Verify that the release was promoted to the channel:

  ```
  replicated release ls
  ```
