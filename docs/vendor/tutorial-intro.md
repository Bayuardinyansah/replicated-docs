# Introduction

Welcome to the Replicated Getting Started Tutorials!

This section includes the following tutorials:
* **UI Tutorial**: Use the Replicated vendor portal user interface.
* **CLI tutorial**: Use the replicated CLI rather than vendor portal.

## Learning Objectives

These tutorials include steps for using the Replicated vendor tools to do the following:
* Create an application object
* Create and promote a release for the application
* Release a new version of the application

Enterprise user tools to do the following:
* Install an application for the first time on an existing cluster and on a cluster provisioned by the Replicated Kubernetes installer
* Update an application after a newer version is released using the Replicated admin console

## Additional Labs

In addition to these tutorials, you can also complete a series of beginner, intermediate, and advanced labs. The labs run in a sandbox environment that automatically provisions the required Kubernetes cluster or VM.
