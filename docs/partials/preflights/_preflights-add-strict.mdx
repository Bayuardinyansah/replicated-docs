(Optional) Set any preflight analyzers to `strict: true` if you want to enforce requirements for the chosen analyzers. Note the following considerations:

  - Any `fail` outcomes for that analyzer block the deployment of the release until your specified requirement is met.
  -  If a `strict` collector requires cluster scope and minimal RBAC mode is set, then the collector is skipped during the preflight check.
  - Strict preflight analyzers are ignored if the `exclude` flag is also used.

    For more information about strict preflight checks, see [`strict`](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/analyze/#strict) in the Troubleshoot documentation. For more information about cluster privileges, see `requireMinimalRBACPrivileges` for name-scoped access in [Configuring Role-Based Access](packaging-rbac#namespace-scoped-access).
