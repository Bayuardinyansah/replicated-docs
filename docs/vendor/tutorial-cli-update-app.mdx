# Step 9: Update the Application

To test the new release that you promoted, return to the Replicated admin console in a browser to update the application.

To update the application:

1. In a browser, open the admin console at `https://localhost:8800`.

   :::note
   You can access the admin console as long as the installation script is running. If you press Ctrl+C to exit, run `kubectl kots admin-console --namespace cli-tutorial` to access the admin console again.
   :::

1. On the Version History page, click **Check for Updates**.

   The admin console loads the new version that you promoted.

1. Click **Diff versions** to review the changes that you made to the YAML files.

1. Click **Deploy** to deploy the new version.

1. After the new version is deployed, go to the **Config** tab. In the **Another Text Example** field that you added, enter any text. Click **Save**.

1. Deploy the configuration change.

1. On the **Dashboard** tab, click **Open App**.

   The application displays the text that you added in the new field from the configuration page.

## Next Steps

You can iterate further on your application. Continue making changes and using `replicated release create --auto` to publish them. You can add `-y` to the command to skip the prompt.
