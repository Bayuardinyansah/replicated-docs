# Step 7: Deploy the Application

At this point, Kubernetes and the Replicated admin console are running, but the application is not deployed yet.

To deploy the application:

1. In a browser, enter the URL that the installation script displayed previously when it finished.

1. On the Bypass browser TLS warning page, click **Continue to Setup**.

1. Click Advanced, then Proceed to 34.27.71.198 (unsafe)

1. On the HTTPS for App Name admin console page, click **Skip & continue** to proceed using the self-signed certificate.

1. Enter the password from the CLI output to log in to the admin console.

    The **Upload your license file** page opens. Until this point, this server is running Docker, Kubernetes, and the admin console containers only.

1. Select your YAML license file or drag and drop the license file from your desktop. Click **Upload license**.
    The admin console can pull containers and run your application now.

    The configuration page opens with default configuration items.

1. On the configuration page, select the **Use Ingress?** checkbox. Leave the **Ingress Hostname** field blank. Click **Continue**.

1. Click **Continue**. If there are failing checks, click **Deploy and continue** in the dialog. Preflight checks are designed to help ensure this server has the minimum system and software requirements to run the application. Depending on your YAML configuration in `preflight.yaml`, you can see some of the example preflight checks fail.

    After the preflight checks pass, the Version History page opens and displays the initial version that was deployed. Later, you will come back to this page to deploy an update to the application.

1. Click the **Dashboard** tab to see the status of the application and some basic monitoring statistics (such as CPU, memory, and disk space).

1. If you are still connected to this server using SSH, `kubectl get pods` shows the example NGINX service that you just deployed.

    ```
    NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    example-nginx-67f4f5dd7-gtqpp        1/1     Running   0          4m39s
    kotsadm-759486cc77-hcp8r             1/1     Running   0          71m
    kotsadm-rqlite-0                     1/1     Running   0          71m
    kurl-proxy-kotsadm-697fc4bff-ccjhz   1/1     Running   0          71m
    ```


1. Since you used the default NGINX application and enabled the Ingress object, you can view the application at `http://${INSTANCE_IP}/` without a port and see a basic NGINX server running:

Next, you will create and deliver an update to the sample application.
