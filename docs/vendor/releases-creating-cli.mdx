# Managing Releases with the CLI

This topic describes how to use the replicated CLI to create and promote releases.

For information about creating and managing releases with the vendor portal, see [Managing Releases with the Vendor Portal](/vendor/releases-creating-releases).

For information about creating and managing releases with the Vendor API v3, see the [releases](https://replicated-vendor-api.readme.io/reference/createrelease) section in the Vendor API v3 documentation.

## Prerequisites

Before you create a release using the replicated CLI, complete the following prerequisites:

* Install the replicated CLI and then log in to authorize the CLI. See [Installing the replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).
  
* Create a new application using the `replicated app create APP_NAME` command. You only need to do this procedure one time for each application that you want to deploy. See [`app create`](/reference/replicated-cli-app-create) in _Reference_.

* Set the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable to the slug of the target application. See [Set Environment Variables](/reference/replicated-cli-installing#env-var) in _Installing the replicated CLI_.

  **Example**:

  ```bash
  export REPLICATED_APP=my-app-slug
  ```

## Create a Release From a Local Directory {#dir}

You can use the replicated CLI to create a release from a local directory that contains the release files.

To create and promote a release:

1. (Helm Charts Only) If your release contains any Helm charts:

   1. Package each Helm chart as a `.tgz` file. See [Packaging a Helm Chart for a Release](/vendor/helm-install-release).

   1. Move the `.tgz` file or files to the local directory that contains the release files:

       ```
       mv CHART_TGZ PATH_TO_RELEASE_DIR
       ```
       Where:
       * `CHART_TGZ` is the `.tgz` Helm chart archive.
       * `PATH_TO_RELEASE_DIR` is path to the local directory that contains the release files.

       **Example**

       ```
       mv wordpress-1.3.5.tgz manifests
       ```

   1. (KOTS Only) In the same directory that contains the release files, add a HelmChart custom resource for each Helm chart in the release. See [Configuring the HelmChart Custom Resource](helm-native-v2-using).

1. Lint the application manifest files and ensure that there are no errors in the YAML:
 
    ```bash
    replicated release lint --yaml-dir=PATH_TO_APP_DIR
    ```

    Where `PATH_TO_APP_DIR` is path to the local directory with your application files.

    For more information about linting, see [release lint](/reference/replicated-cli-release-lint) and [Linter Rules](/reference/linter).   

1. Do one of the following:

   * **Create and promote the release with one command**:

      ```
      replicated release create --yaml-dir PATH_TO_APP_DIR --lint --promote CHANNEL
      ```
      Where:
      * `PATH_TO_APP_DIR` is path to the local directory that contains the files for the release.
      * `CHANNEL` is the channel ID or the case sensitive name of the channel.

   * **Create and edit the release before promoting**:

      1. Create the release:

          ```bash
          replicated release create --yaml-dir PATH_TO_APP_DIR
          ```
          Where `PATH_TO_APP_DIR` is path to the local directory with your application files.

          For more information, see [release create](/reference/replicated-cli-release-create) or [release update](/reference/replicated-cli-release-update) in _Reference_.

      1. Edit and update the release as desired:

          ```
          replicated release update SEQUENCE --yaml-dir PATH_TO_APP_DIR
          ```
          Where:
            
          -  `SEQUENCE` is the release sequence number. This identifies the existing release to be updated.
          -  `PATH_TO_APP_DIR` is path to the local directory with your application files.

          For more information, see [release update](/reference/replicated-cli-release-update) in _Reference_.

      1. Promote the release when you are ready to test it. Releases cannot be edited after they are promoted. To make changes after promotion, create a new release.

          ```
          replicated release promote SEQUENCE CHANNEL
          ```

          Where:
            
          -  `SEQUENCE` with the release sequence number.
          -  `CHANNEL` with the channel ID or the case sensitive name of the channel.

          For more information, see [release promote](/reference/replicated-cli-release-promote) in the replicated CLI documentation.

1. Verify that the release was promoted to the target channel:

    ```
    replicated release ls
    ```

## Create a Release With a Helm Chart Only

For applications that contain only one Helm chart, you can use the `--chart` flag to create a release.

To create a release that contains one Helm chart:

1. Package the chart as a `.tgz` file. See [Packaging a Helm Chart for a Release](/vendor/helm-install-release).

1. Create and promote the release:
   
   ```bash
   replicated release create --chart=CHART_ARCHIVE --promote=CHANNEL
   ```

   Where:
   * `CHART_ARCHIVE` is the Helm chart `.tgz` file. For example, `--chart=my-chart-1.0.0.tgz`.
   * `CHANNEL` is the channel ID or the case sensitive name of the channel.

1. Verify that the release was promoted to the channel:

    ```
    replicated release ls
    ```
