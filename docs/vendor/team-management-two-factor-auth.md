# Managing Two-Factor Authentication

This topic describes how to enable and disable two-factor authentication for individual and team accounts in the Replicated vendor portal.

## About Two-Factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides additional security by requiring two methods of authentication to access resources and data. When you enable the 2FA option in the vendor portal, you are asked to provide an authentication code and your password during authentication. Replicated utilizes the open algorithm known as the Time-based One-time Password (TOTP 7), which is specified by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) under RFC 6238 2.

Administrators must first enable their own individual account before enabling it for teams. Then team members can enable their individual accounts.

:::note
If SAML Authentication or Google Authentication is configured for your team, then 2FA is bypassed, if it is enabled. You can leave 2FA enabled, but you are not prompted to enter a code when logging in.

## Enable 2FA on Individual Accounts

If you are an administrator or if 2FA is enabled for your team, you can enable 2FA on your individual account.

To enable two-factor authentication on your account:

1. In the [vendor portal](https://vendor.replicated.com), click **Account Settings** from the dropdown list in the upper right corner of the screen.

1. In the **Confirm password** dialog, enter your vendor portal account password. Click **Confirm password**.

1. Scan the QR code that displays using a supported two-factor authentication application on your mobile device, such as Google Authenticator. Alternatively, click **Use this text code** in the vendor portal to generate an alphanumeric code that you enter in the mobile application.

    Your mobile application displays an authentication code.

1. Enter the authentication code in the vendor portal.

    Two-factor authentication is enabled and a list of recovery codes is displayed at the bottom of the **Two-Factor Authentication** pane.

1. Save the recovery codes in a secure location. These codes can be used any time (one time per code), if you lose your mobile device.

1. Log out of your account and log back in to test that it is enabled. You are prompted to enter a one-time code generated by the application on your mobile device.


## Disable 2FA on Individual Accounts

To disable two-factor authentication on your account:

1. In the [vendor portal](https://vendor.replicated.com), click **Account Settings** from the dropdown list in the upper right corner of the screen.

    <img src="/images/vendor-portal-account-settings.png" alt="Vendor portal account settings" width="300"/>

1. In the **Two-Factor Authentication** pane, click **Turn off two-factor authentication**.

1. In the **Confirm password** dialog, enter your vendor portal account password. Click **Confirm password**.

## Enable or Disable 2FA for a Team

As an administrator, you can enable or disable 2FA for a team. Then team members can enable or disable 2FA on their individual accounts.

To enable or disable 2FA for a team:

1. In the [vendor portal](https://vendor.replicated.com), select the **Team** tab, then select **Multifactor Auth**.

    - Turn on the toggle to enable 2FA
    - Turn off the toggle to disable 2FA

1. Click **Save changes**.
