# Replicated FAQs

This topic lists frequently-asked questions (FAQs) for the Replicated Platform.

## Platform FAQs

### If I distribute my application with Replicated, can my customers still install with the Helm CLI?

Yes.

## Compatibility Matrix FAQs

### What types of clusters can I create with Compatibility Matrix?

### How does billing work?

### How do I buy more credits?

## KOTS and Embedded Cluster FAQs

### What is the difference between the KOTS and Embedded Cluster installers?

### What do I have to do to enable Embedded Cluster installations for my application?

Enabling Embedded Cluster installations requires that the Replicated KOTS entitlement is assigned to your Vendor Portal team.

Teams with the KOTS entitlement can create KOTS-enabled releases by configuring the custom resources required by KOTS to install the application. You also need to add the Embedded Cluster Config.

For a checklist of the required and optional custom resources for KOTS, see [Onboarding with KOTS](/vendor/distributing-workflow).

### How do Embedded Cluster installations on VMs or bare metal servers work?

In installations on VMs or bare metal servers, users run an installation command that provisions a cluster on a VM or bare metal server.

KOTS then deploys the Admin Console in the cluster, where users can log in to provide their license file, define application-specific configuration values, run preflight checks, and install the application.

For more information, see [Using Embedded Cluster](/vendor/embedded-overview).

### What's the difference between Replicated Embedded Cluster and kURL?

Replicated Embedded Cluster is a successor to Replicated kURL. Compared to kURL, Embedded Cluster feature offers significantly faster installation, updates, and node joins, a redesigned Admin Console UI, improved support for multi-node clusters, one-click updates that update the application and the cluster at the same time, and more.

For more information, see [Using Embedded Cluster](/vendor/embedded-overview) or [Introduction to kURL](/vendor/kurl-about).

### Can I use my own branding for KOTS installations?

The KOTS Admin Console and the Customer Portal support the use of a custom logo. Additionally, software vendors can use custom domains for Replicated services to avoid exposing the default Replicated domains to enterprise users.

For more information, see [Customizing the Admin Console and Customer Portal](/vendor/admin-console-customize-app-icon) and [About Custom Domains](custom-domains).

### Does Replicated support installations into air gap environments?

Yes. Software vendors can use KOTS to generate air gap bundles for installation into air gap environments. KOTS also provides customer-specific download portals where air gap bundles and license files can be shared with enterprise users.

Air gap installations are supported for existing and embedded clusters. 

### Can I deploy Helm charts with KOTS?

Yes. An application deployed with KOTS can use one or more Helm charts, can include Helm charts as components, and can use more than a single instance of any Helm chart. Each Helm chart deployed by KOTS requires a unique HelmChart custom resource (`apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta2`) in the release.

For more information, see [About Distributing Helm Charts with KOTS](/vendor/helm-native-about).

### What are the use cases for installing applications with Embedded Cluster versus Helm?

Helm is a popular package manager for Kubernetes applications. Many enterprise users that have experience with Kubernetes and Helm will expect to be able to install an application with the Helm CLI. 

The UI-based installation experience of KOTS can provide an easier installation experience for enterprise users that do not have experience with Kubernetes or Helm. Additionally, KOTS provides support for installations into air gap environments, which is not directly supported by Helm.

### Can I support both Helm CLI and KOTS installations for my application?

Yes. Software vendors that distribute their application as one or more Helm charts can support installations with both the Helm CLI and with KOTS from the same release.

For a tutorial that demonstrates how to add the Bitnami Gitea Helm chart to a release in the Replicated Vendor Portal and then install with both KOTS and the Helm CLI, see [Install a Helm Chart with KOTS and Helm CLI](/vendor/tutorial-kots-helm-setup).

### How does the Replicated SDK work with KOTS?

The Replicated SDK is a Helm chart that can be installed as a small service alongside an application, or as a standalone component. The SDK can be installed using the Helm CLI or KOTS.

Replicated recommends that all applications include the SDK because it provides access to key functionality not available through KOTS, such as support for sending custom metrics from application instances. When both the SDK and KOTS are installed in a cluster alongside an application, both send instance telemetry to the Vendor Portal.

For more information, see [Installing the Replicated SDK](/vendor/replicated-sdk-installing).
