# Step 6: Install the App Manager

Get the installation commands from the Unstable channel so that you can test the installation process for the application release that you promoted. The first step in installing and deploying the application in your Kubernetes cluster is to install the Replicated app manager.

The _app manager_ is the Replicated component that allows your users to install, manage, and upgrade your application. Users can interact with the app manager through a user interface, called the Replicated admin console, or through a CLI, called the kots CLI.

:::note
This step requires you to have kubectl access to a Kubernetes cluster. Before you begin, ensure that you have completed the required  setup steps to create the cluster and configure kubectl command line access. See [Set Up the Environment](tutorial-cli-setup#set-up-the-environment) in _Introduction and Setup_.
:::

To install the app manager in your Kubernetes cluster:

1. Run the following command to get the installation commands for the Unstable channel, where you promoted the release for the `cli-tutorial` application:

    ```
    replicated channel inspect Unstable
    ```

    **Example output:**

    ```
    ID:             2GmYFUFzj8JOSLYw0jAKKJKFua8
    NAME:           Unstable
    DESCRIPTION:
    RELEASE:        1
    VERSION:        Unstable-d4173a4
    EXISTING:

        curl -fsSL https://kots.io/install | bash
        kubectl kots install cli-tutorial/unstable

    EMBEDDED:

        curl -fsSL https://k8s.kurl.sh/cli-tutorial-unstable | sudo bash

    AIRGAP:

        curl -fSL -o cli-tutorial-unstable.tar.gz https://k8s.kurl.sh/bundle/cli-tutorial-unstable.tar.gz
        # ... scp or sneakernet cli-tutorial-unstable.tar.gz to airgapped machine, then
        tar xvf cli-tutorial-unstable.tar.gz
        sudo bash ./install.sh airgap
    ```
    This command prints information about the channel, including the commands for installing in:
    * An existing cluster
    * An _embedded_ cluster created by the Replicated Kubernetes installer
    * An air gap cluster that is not connected to the Internet

1. If you have not already, configure kubectl access to the cluster you provisioned as part of [Set Up the Environment](tutorial-cli-setup#set-up-the-environment). For more information about configuring kubectl, see [Command line tool (kubectl)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

1. Run the `EXISTING` installation script from above:

  **Example**

  ```
  curl -fsSL https://kots.io/install | bash
  kubectl kots install cli-tutorial/unstable
  ```

1. For `Enter installation path (leave blank for /usr/local/bin):`, press **Enter**.

1. For `Enter the namespace to deploy to:`, enter `cli-tutorial`.

1. For `Enter a new password to be used for the Admin Console:`, provide a password to access the admin console. You use this password in a later step to access the admin console user interface and deploy the application.

   When the admin console is ready, the script prints the `https://localhost:8800` URL where you can access the admin console.

   **Example output**:

   ```
   Enter the namespace to deploy to: cli-tutorial
    • Deploying Admin Console
      • Creating namespace ✓
      • Waiting for datastore to be ready ✓
   Enter a new password to be used for the Admin Console: ••••••••
      • Waiting for Admin Console to be ready ✓

      • Press Ctrl+C to exit
      • Go to http://localhost:8800 to access the Admin Console
   ```

## Next Step

Continue to [Step 7: Deploy the Application](tutorial-cli-deploy-app) to log in to the admin console and deploy the application.
