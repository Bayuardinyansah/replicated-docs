# KOTS Release Workflows

This topic provides prerequisites and workflows for creating a Replicated KOTS release for your application with and without the Replicated SDK.

## About Releasing your Application

A KOTS release for your application can include a set of standard Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, or Kubernetes Operators. (While an operator is technically deployed either using plain Kubernetes manifests or a Helm chart, we list it separately because of the advanced image management work needed to effectively deliver Operators into customer environments.) 

In addition to your application files, a release also includes [Replicated custom resources](/reference/custom-resource-about) that are used to invoke various Replicated KOTS functions.

After you create the first release for your application, you continue the process of authoring, testing, iterating on, and accepting a set of files for release to your customers. Replicated recommends that you create and test releases for your application in small iterations before sharing a release with your customers. To begin, see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) below.

If you have questions about these workflows, you can post a question on our [Community site](https://community.replicated.com/).

## Supported Installation Types

From a single release, you can support one or more of these installation methods.

**Install with Helm:**

- Add your Helm chart app to a release in the vendor portal.
- Optionally use the SDK with your Helm chart to get access to Replicated functionality.

**Install with KOTS:**

KOTS is the Replicated installer available to vendors with KOTS entitlements. KOTS provides support for installations on existing clusters, embedded clusters on virtual machines or bare metal servers, and air gap environments.

## Prerequisites

## Plan, Promote, and Test Your Initial Release

Because of the depth and breadth of extensions available in the Replicated platform, Replicated recommends that you create and test releases for your application in small iterations before releasing to customers. With the interdependencies and synergies among Replicated features, it can be helpful to know which features to explore first. Some integrations, like image management and preflight checks, are required or highly recommended. Other features can be integrated in any order after you create your first releases.

The following diagram is a visual representation of the steps that follow for creating and testing your first release. You will iterate many times before distributing your application to customers.

Complete the following procedures to import your application files then create and test your first release:

1. Push your images to the Replicated registry if you plan to host your images on that registry. See [Push Images to the Replicated Registry](packaging-private-images#push-images-to-the-replicated-private-registry) in _Connecting to an Image Registry_.

    If you are using a different image option, skip this step and proceed to the next step.

1. Import your application files to Replicated using one of the following types:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th width="30%">Type</th>
        <th width="70%">Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Helm charts</td>
        <td>To create a release with your Helm chart, add your Helm chart and a Replicated HelmChart custom resource to the release. See <a href="releases-creating-releases">Managing Releases with the Vendor Portal</a> and <a href="helm-release">Creating a Release with Your Helm Chart for KOTS</a>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Standard manifest files</td>
        <td><p>To import using the Replicated vendor portal, see <a href="releases-creating-releases">Managing Releases with the Vendor Portal</a>.</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Kubernetes Operators</td>
        <td>If you are already using Kubernetes Operators, see <a href="operator-packaging-about">Package the Kubernetes Operator Application</a>. <br></br><br></br>Skip connecting to a private registry and skip creating a Configuration screen in the admin console. <br></br><br></br>You can use any of the other packaging functions, depending on your needs. Create a license file, and promote and test each iteration.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

1. If you are using private images, either connect to an external private registry or update the image tags to point to the Replicated registry. See [Connecting to an Image Registry](packaging-private-images).

  :::note
  Skip this step if your images are open-source or public, or if you are using Kubernetes Operators.
  :::

1. If you intend to provide a Replicated kURL specification that your users can run to provision a cluster in their environment, create a Kubernetes installer. See [Creating a Kubernetes Installer](packaging-embedded-kubernetes).

1. Promote the release to the default Unstable channel. For information about promoting releases, see [Managing Releases with the Vendor Portal](releases-creating-releases).

1. Create a license file in the vendor portal and assign the license to the Unstable channel. You need a license file to test your releases. See [Creating and Managing Customers](releases-creating-customer).

1. Test the release by installing in a development environment with the license file that you created. For information about how to install an application, see [Overview of Installing an Application](/enterprise/installing-overview).

After you install the first release for your application, return to the vendor portal to create a new release with additional functionality. See [Add Functionality to Your Releases](#iterate) below. 

## Add Functionality to Your Releases {#iterate}

You integrate with KOTS features and add additional functionality to your application by creating and promoting additional releases on the Unstable channel. Test each release in your development environment until you are ready to share the application with your customers. 

The following table gives a suggested order, but you can add functionality in any order. The functionality described in the table can be used with Kubernetes Operators, except where noted.
