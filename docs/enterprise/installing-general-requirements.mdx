# Installation Requirements

This topic describes the requirements for installing applications with the Replicated KOTS and Replicated kURL installers.

:::note
This topic does not include any requirements specific to your software vendor. Ensure that you meet any additional requirements for the application defined by your software vendor.
:::

## Supported Browsers

The following table lists the browser requirements for the Replicated admin console with the latest version of KOTS.

| Browser              | Support     |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Chrome               | 66+         |
| Firefox              | 58+         |
| Opera                | 53+         |
| Edge                 | 80+         |
| Safari (Mac OS only) | 13+         |
| Internet Explorer    | Unsupported |

## Kubernetes Version Compatibility

Each release of KOTS maintains compatibility with the current Kubernetes version, and the two most recent versions at the time of its release. This includes support against all patch releases of the corresponding Kubernetes version.

Kubernetes versions 1.24 and earlier are end-of-life (EOL). For more information about Kubernetes versions, see [Release History](https://kubernetes.io/releases/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

Replicated recommends using a version of KOTS that is compatible with Kubernetes 1.25 and higher.

<KubernetesCompatibility/>


## Existing Cluster Requirements

To install KOTS in an existing cluster, your environment must meet the following minimum requirements.

### Minimum System Requirements

To install the admin console on an existing cluster, the cluster must meet the following requirements:

* **Admin console minimum requirements**: The admin console requires a minimum of 5GB of disk space on the cluster. This includes 4GB for the object store PersistentVolume and 1GB for the rqlite PersistentVolume. The admin console pod requests 100m CPU resources and 100Mi memory. Existing clusters that have LimitRanges specified must support these values. For more information, see [Installing Without Object Storage](installing-stateful-component-requirements).
* **Kubernetes version compatibility**: The version of Kubernetes running on the cluster must be compatible with the version of KOTS that you use to install the application. This compatibility requirement does not include any specific and additional requirements defined by the software vendor for the application.

  For more information about the versions of Kubernetes that are compatible with each version of KOTS, see [Kubernetes Version Compatibility](#kubernetes-version-compatibility) above.
* **OpenShift version compatibility**: For Red Hat OpenShift clusters, the version of OpenShift must use a supported Kubernetes version. For more information about supported Kubernetes versions, see [Kubernetes Version Compatibility](#kubernetes-version-compatibility) above.
* **Storage class**: The cluster must have an existing storage class available. For more information, see [Storage Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/) in the Kubernetes documentation.
* **Port forwarding**: To support port forwarding, Kubernetes clusters require that the SOcket CAT (socat) package is installed on each node.

  If the package is not installed on each node in the cluster, you see the following error message when the installation script attempts to connect to the admin console: `unable to do port forwarding: socat not found`.

  To check if the package that provides socat is installed, you can run `which socat`. If the package is installed, the `which socat` command prints the full path to the socat executable file. For example, `usr/bin/socat`.

  If the output of the `which socat` command is `socat not found`, then you must install the package that provides the socat command. The name of this package can vary depending on the node's operating system.

### RBAC Requirements

The user that runs the installation command must have at least the minimum role-based access control (RBAC) permissions that are required by KOTS. If the user does not have the required RBAC permissions, then an error message displays: `Current user has insufficient privileges to install Admin Console`.

The required RBAC permissions vary depending on if the user attempts to install KOTS with cluster-scoped access or namespace-scoped access:
* [Cluster-scoped RBAC Requirements (Default)](#cluster-scoped)
* [Namespace-scoped RBAC Requirements](#namespace-scoped)

#### Cluster-scoped RBAC Requirements (Default) {#cluster-scoped}

By default, KOTS requires cluster-scoped access. With cluster-scoped access, a Kubernetes ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding are created that grant KOTS access to all resources across all namespaces in the cluster.

To install KOTS with cluster-scoped access, the user must meet the following RBAC requirements:
* The user must be able to create workloads, ClusterRoles, and ClusterRoleBindings.
* The user must have cluster-admin permissions to create namespaces and assign RBAC roles across the cluster.

#### Namespace-scoped RBAC Requirements {#namespace-scoped}

KOTS can be installed with namespace-scoped access rather than the default cluster-scoped access. With namespace-scoped access, a Kubernetes Role and RoleBinding are automatically created that grant KOTS permissions only in the namespace where it is installed.

:::note
Depending on the application, namespace-scoped access for KOTS is required, optional, or not supported. Contact your software vendor for application-specific requirements.
:::

To install or upgrade KOTS with namespace-scoped access, the user must have _one_ of the following permission levels in the target namespace:

* **Wildcard permissions (Default)**: By default, when namespace-scoped access is enabled, KOTS attempts to automatically create the following Role to acquire wildcard (`* * *`) permissions in the target namespace:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: "rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1"
  kind: "Role"
  metadata:
    name: "kotsadm-role"
  rules:
    - apiGroups: ["*"]
      resources: ["*"]
      verb: "*"
  ```

   To support this default behavior, the user must also have `* * *` permissions in the target namespace.

* **Minimum KOTS RBAC permissions**: In some cases, it is not possible to grant the user `* * *` permissions in the target namespace. For example, an organization might have security policies that prevent this level of permissions.

  If the user installing or upgrading KOTS cannot be granted `* * *` permissions in the namespace, then they can instead request the minimum RBAC permissions required by KOTS. Using the minimum KOTS RBAC permissions also requires manually creating a ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleBinding for KOTS, rather than allowing KOTS to automatically create a Role with `* * *` permissions.

  To use the minimum KOTS RBAC permissions to install or upgrade:

  1. Ensure that the user has the minimum RBAC permissions required by KOTS. The following lists the minimum RBAC permissions:

    ```yaml
      - apiGroups: [""]
        resources: ["configmaps", "persistentvolumeclaims", "pods", "secrets", "services", "limitranges"]
        verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
      - apiGroups: ["apps"]
        resources: ["daemonsets", "deployments", "statefulsets"]
        verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
      - apiGroups: ["batch"]
        resources: ["jobs", "cronjobs"]
        verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
      - apiGroups: ["networking.k8s.io", "extensions"]
        resources: ["ingresses"]
        verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
      - apiGroups: [""]
        resources: ["namespaces", "endpoints", "serviceaccounts"]
        verbs: ["get"]
      - apiGroups: ["authorization.k8s.io"]
        resources: ["selfsubjectaccessreviews", "selfsubjectrulesreviews"]
        verbs: ["create"]
      - apiGroups: ["rbac.authorization.k8s.io"]
        resources: ["roles", "rolebindings"]
        verbs: ["get"]
      - apiGroups: [""]
        resources: ["pods/log", "pods/exec"]
        verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create"]
      - apiGroups: ["batch"]
        resources: ["jobs/status"]
        verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
    ```

    :::note
    The minimum RBAC requirements can vary slightly depending on the cluster's Kubernetes distribution and the version of KOTS. Contact your software vendor if you have the required RBAC permissions listed above and you see an error related to RBAC during installation or upgrade.
    ::: 

   1. Save the following ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleBinding to a single YAML file, such as `rbac.yaml`:

      ```yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: ServiceAccount
      metadata:
        labels:
          kots.io/backup: velero
          kots.io/kotsadm: "true"
        name: kotsadm
      ---
      apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
      kind: Role
      metadata:
        labels:
          kots.io/backup: velero
          kots.io/kotsadm: "true"
        name: kotsadm-role
      rules:
        - apiGroups: [""]
          resources: ["configmaps", "persistentvolumeclaims", "pods", "secrets", "services", "limitranges"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
        - apiGroups: ["apps"]
          resources: ["daemonsets", "deployments", "statefulsets"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
        - apiGroups: ["batch"]
          resources: ["jobs", "cronjobs"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
        - apiGroups: ["networking.k8s.io", "extensions"]
          resources: ["ingresses"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
        - apiGroups: [""]
          resources: ["namespaces", "endpoints", "serviceaccounts"]
          verbs: ["get"]
        - apiGroups: ["authorization.k8s.io"]
          resources: ["selfsubjectaccessreviews", "selfsubjectrulesreviews"]
          verbs: ["create"]
        - apiGroups: ["rbac.authorization.k8s.io"]
          resources: ["roles", "rolebindings"]
          verbs: ["get"]
        - apiGroups: [""]
          resources: ["pods/log", "pods/exec"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create"]
        - apiGroups: ["batch"]
          resources: ["jobs/status"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
      ---
      apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
      kind: RoleBinding
      metadata:
        labels:
          kots.io/backup: velero
          kots.io/kotsadm: "true"
        name: kotsadm-rolebinding
      roleRef:
        apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
        kind: Role
        name: kotsadm-role
      subjects:
        - kind: ServiceAccount
          name: kotsadm
      ```

    1. If the application contains any Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), add the CRDs to the Role in the YAML file that you created in the previous step with as many permissions as possible: `["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]`.

      :::note
      Contact your software vendor for information about any CRDs that are included in the application.
      :::

      **Example**

      ```yaml
       rules:
       - apiGroups: ["stable.example.com"]
         resources: ["crontabs"]
         verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
      ```
    
    1. Run the following command to create the RBAC resources for KOTS in the namespace:

     ```
     kubectl apply -f RBAC_YAML_FILE -n TARGET_NAMESPACE
     ```

     Replace:
       * `RBAC_YAML_FILE` with the name of the YAML file with the ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleBinding and that you created.
       * `TARGET_NAMESPACE` with the namespace where the user will install KOTS.

  :::note
  After manually creating these RBAC resources, the user must include both the `--ensure-rbac=false` and `--skip-rbac-check` flags when installing or upgrading. These flags prevent KOTS from checking for or attempting to create a Role with `* * *` permissions in the namespace. For more information, see [Prerequisites](installing-existing-cluster.md#prerequisites) in _Online Installation in Existing Clusters_.
  :::

## Embedded Cluster Requirements {#embedded-cluster-requirements}

To install KOTS in an embedded cluster created by kURL, your environment must meet the following requirements.

### Minimum System Requirements

* 4 CPUs or equivalent per machine.
* 8GB of RAM per machine.
* 40GB of disk space per machine.
* TCP ports 2379, 2380, 6443, 6783, 10250, 10251, and 10252 open between cluster nodes.
* UDP ports 6783 and 6784 open between cluster nodes.
* Root access is required.
* (Rook Only) The Rook add-on version 1.4.3 and later requires block storage on each node in the cluster. For more information about how to enable block storage for Rook, see [Block Storage](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/rook/#block-storage) in _Rook Add-On_ in the kURL documentation.

### Additional System Requirements

You must meet the additional kURL system requirements when applicable:

- **Supported Operating Systems**: For supported operating systems, see [Supported Operating Systems](https://kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/system-requirements#supported-operating-systems) in the kURL documentation.

- **kURL Dependencies Directory**: kURL installs additional dependencies in the directory /var/lib/kurl and the directory requirements must be met. See [kURL Dependencies Directory](https://kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/system-requirements#kurl-dependencies-directory) in the kURL documentation.

- **Networking Requirements**: Networking requirements include firewall openings, host firewalls rules, and port availability. See [Networking Requirements](https://kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/system-requirements#networking-requirements) in the kURL documentation.

- **High Availability Requirements**: If you are operating a cluster with high availability, see [High Availability Requirements](https://kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/system-requirements#high-availability-requirements) in the kURL documentation.

- **Cloud Disk Performance**: For a list of cloud VM instance and disk combinations that are known to provide sufficient performance for etcd and pass the write latency preflight, see [Cloud Disk Performance](https://kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/system-requirements#cloud-disk-performance) in the kURL documentation.


## Private Registry Requirements

A private image registry is required for air gap installations. For air gap installations in existing clusters, you must provide credentials for a compatible private registry during installation. For air gap installations in embedded clusters, the kURL installer automatically uses the registry add-on to meet the private registry requirement. For more information, see [Registry Add-on](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/registry) in the kURL documentation.

Private registry settings can be changed at any time. For more information, see [Using Private Registries](image-registry-settings).

KOTS has been tested for compatibility with the following registries:

<DockerCompatibility/>

## Firewall Openings for Online Installations

The following domains need to be accessible from servers performing online installations.
For a list of IP addresses for these services, see [replicatedhq/ips](https://github.com/replicatedhq/ips/blob/master/ip_addresses.json) in GitHub.

No outbound internet access is required for air gapped installations.
