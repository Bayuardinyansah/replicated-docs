* The instance checks for available updates:
  * By default, the Replicated SDK and KOTS are both configured to check for updates every four hours.

    :::note
    KOTS users can modify or disable automatic update checks from the admin console. For more information, see [Updating an Application](/enterprise/updating-apps) in the _Enterprise_ section.
    :::

  * For Helm installations that include the Replicated SDK, an update check can occur when the instance makes a request to the `/api/v1/app/updates` SDK API endpoint. See [app](/reference/replicated-sdk-apis#app) in _Replicated SDK API (Alpha)_.

  * For KOTS installations, an update check can occur when a user clicks the **Check for updates** button in the Replicated admin console.

* The status of an instance changes. For example, an instance can change from a Ready to Degraded status. For more information, see [Enabling and Understanding Application Status](insights-app-status).

* (KOTS v1.92 and later only) The instance completes an update to a new application version.
