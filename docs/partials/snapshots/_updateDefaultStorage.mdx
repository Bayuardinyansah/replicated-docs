If your Replicated kURL installer included the Velero add-on, then Velero was automatically installed with default internal storage. Replicated recommends that you proceed to change the default internal storage because it is insufficient for disaster recovery. See [Updating Storage Settings in the Admin Console](snapshots-updating-with-admin-console).
