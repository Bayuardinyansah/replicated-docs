<li><p><strong>(Optional) <code>ports.applicationUrl</code></strong>: When set to the same URL that is specified in the `descriptor.links.url` field of the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource, KOTS adds a link to the given service on the Admin Console dashboard. To construct this link, KOTS rewrites the URL with the hostname in the browser and appends the specified port. See <a href="/vendor/admin-console-adding-buttons-links">Adding Links to the Dashboard.</a></p><p>When not set, there is no link added to the Admin Console dashboard for the given service. For existing cluster installations, users can still access the service with the <code>kubectl kots admin-console</code> command. See <a href="/vendor/admin-console-port-forward#access-port-forwarded-services">Access Port-Forwarded Services.</a></p><p>Consider the following requirements and guidelines:</p><ul><li>The <code>ports.applicationURL</code> and <code>descriptor.links.url</code> fields must match. If the URLs in these fields do not match, then KOTS does not rewrite the URL and the link to the given service is not added to the Admin Console dashboard.</li><li>Use HTTP instead of HTTPS unless TLS termination takes place in the application Pod.</li><li>You can use the name of the service as the hostname for the URL. For example, `http://my-service`. KOTS rewrites the URL with the hostname in the browser during deployment.</li></ul></li>
