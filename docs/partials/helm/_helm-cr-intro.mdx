HelmChart custom resources are required for the app manager to process and deploy Helm charts for the supported Helm installation types. For more information about Helm installation types, see [About Deploying Helm Charts](/vendor/helm-overview).

The HelmChart custom resource manifest file references a required `.tgz` archive of the Helm chart and provides the necessary instructions for processing and preparing the chart for deployment. To deploy multiple instances of the same Helm chart, you must add an additional HelmChart custom resource for each instance. However, only one `.tgz` of the Helm chart needs to be included in the release.
