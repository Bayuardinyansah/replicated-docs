# Downloading the Embedded Cluster CLI Binary

This topic describes how to download the binary for the Embedded Cluster CLI, which is required to install an application with Replicated Embedded Cluster.

## Overview

To install an application with Embedded Cluster, you need to first install the Embedded Cluster CLI. The Embedded Cluster CLI binary is specific to the application; it installs that particular version of the application using the Embedded Cluster config defined in that release.

Your customers can download the binary using the Replicated app service, or you can host/serve the binary yourself using the Replicated Vendor API.

Your customers must take this binary and their license and copy them to the machine where they will install your application.

## Using the Command Line

For online installations, you can run a command to download the Embedded Cluster binary and license directly to the machine. The command to download the binary and license is easily available on the customer page in the vendor portal. You can copy this and share it with your customers.

### Download the Latest Version on the Channel

To download the binary using the Replicated app service:

1. At the top right of the customer page, click **Install instructions** and choose **Embedded cluster**. An **Embedded cluster installation instructions** dialog appears with instructions on how to download the Embedded Cluster binary and install your application:

1. On a VM, run the first two commands displayed on the **Embedded cluster installation instructions** dialog to download the binary and license and extract them.

     The following shows an example of the **Embedded cluster installation instructions** dialog:

     :::note
     You can configure a custom domain for the `replicated.app` endpoint so that your customers can download the binary from your own domain instead of from `replicated.app`. For more information, see [About Custom Domains](/vendor/custom-domains).

### Download a Specific Version

To download the binary for a particular application release version, specify the target version label to the end of the `curl` command:

```
curl https://replicated.app/embedded/gitea-mastodon/unstable/VERSION_LABEL
```

Where `VERSION_LABEL` is the version of the target release.

**Example:**

```
curl https://replicated.app/embedded/gitea-mastodon/unstable/1.2.3
```

## Using the Vendor API

Some vendors already have a portal where customers can log in to to access documentation or download artifacts. In cases like this, you can serve the Embedded Cluster binary yourself using the Replicated Vendor API.

To serve the binary with the Vendor API:

1. If you have not done so already, create an API token for the Vendor API. See [Using the Vendor API v3](/reference/vendor-api-using#api-token-requirement).

1. Call the [Get an Embedded Cluster release](https://replicated-vendor-api.readme.io/reference/getembeddedclusterrelease) endpoint to download the artifacts needed to install your application in an embedded cluster.

     Note the following:

     * (Recommended) Provide the `customerId` query parameter so that the customerâ€™s license is included in the downloaded tarball. This mirrors what is returned when a customer downloads the binary directly using the Replicated app service and is the most useful option. Excluding the `customerId` is useful if you plan to distribute the license separately.

     * If you do not provide any query parameters, this endpoint downloads the Embedded Cluster binary for the latest release on the specified channel. You can provide the `channelSequence` query parameter to download the binary for a particular release.
