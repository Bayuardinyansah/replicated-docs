# Viewing Status Details

The application status displays on the dashboard of the Replicated admin console. Viewing the status details can be helpful for troubleshooting states, such as Missing.

There are two ways to view the status details:

- (Version 1.51.0 and later) Click **Details** next to the status on the dashboard.
- (Version 1.50.2 and earlier) Review the diagnostic information in `kots/admin_console/kotsadm-/kotsadm.log` in the support bundle. For more information about generating a support bundle, see [Troubleshooting an Application](troubleshooting-an-app).

  :::note
  For information about updating your admin console, see [Updating the Admin Console on an Existing Cluster](updating-existing-cluster) or [Updating the Admin Console on a Kubernetes Installer-Created Cluster](updating-embedded-cluster).
