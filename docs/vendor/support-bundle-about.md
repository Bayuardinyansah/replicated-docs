# About Support Bundles

This topic provides an introduction to support bundles.

## Overview

Support bundles let you collect and analyze troubleshooting data from customer environments to help you diagnose problems with application deployments.

## Customizing Support Bundles

## Generating Support Bundles

All customers can generate support bundles using the support-bundle CLI. Additionally, Replicated KOTS customers can generate support bundles through the Replicated admin console. 

Customers can share the results with your team by sending you the resulting tar.gz file.

Replicated KOTS customers can also generate support bundles from the Replicated admin console and share them with your support team.

For more information about generating support bundles for KOTS and Helm CLI installations, see [Generating Support Bundles](support-bundle-generating).

## Inspecting Support Bundles

For any installation, your support team can upload the support bundle to the Replicated vendor portal to view and interpret the analysis. If you need help resolving an issue, you can open an issue on the [Community site](https://community.replicated.com/). 
You can use the vendor portal to run an analysis and inspect a customer's support bundle if they need help troubleshooting. For more information, see [Inspecting Support Bundles](support-inspecting-support-bundles).

You can also open a support request ticket with Replicated if you have an SLA. Severity 1 issues are resolved three times faster when submitted with support bundles.
