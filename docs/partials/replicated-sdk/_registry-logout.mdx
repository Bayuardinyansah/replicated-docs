(Recommended) Log out of the Replicated registry:

    ```bash
    helm registry logout registry.replicated.com
    ```

    Replicated recommends that you log out of the Replicated registry to avoid errors that can occur when Helm attempts to pull the SDK chart from the registry if you are logged in with a license that has expired.
