# Onboarding Workflow

Goals: 

- How to onboard with the Replicated platform
- How to distribute/install a Helm chart (specific to SDK)
- Learn what the workflow is for releasing and installing so they know how to iterate and test in a development environment.    
- Don't talk about KOTS



This topic provides prerequisites and workflows for creating a Helm release for your application with the Replicated SDK.

## About Releasing your Application

A Helm release for your application includes one or more Helm charts. When you distribute your Helm-based application using the Helm installation method, you can add the Replicated SDK features to your release for better management, insights, and security of your deployed application.

After you create the first release for your application, you continue the process of authoring, testing, iterating on, and accepting a set of files for release to your customers. Replicated recommends that you create and test releases for your application in small iterations before sharing a release with your customers. To begin, see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) below.

If you have questions about this workflow, you can post a question on our [Community site](https://community.replicated.com/).

## Supported Installation Type

When you include the SDK with a Helm chart release, you use the Helm installation.

## Prerequisites

Additionally, supporting Helm installations has the following requirements:

## Helm with SDK Release

**Audience:** New vendors who want to use SDK features with Helm installations.

When you add the SDK to a Helm release, you get the benefits of the SDK features, including the ability to use the proxy service for license validation without exposing your registry credentials.

Complete the following procedures to create and test a Helm release that enables using the SDK:

1. (Recommended) Familiarize yourself by using the SDK in integration mode. This lets you test the SDK API with mock data in a local environment without making changes to your release in the vendor portal. See [Developing Against the SDK API](replicated-sdk-development).

  Integration mode testing is a fast, reliable way to test and iterate every time you create or update a release, before committing changes in the vendor portal and performing full testing.

1. Add the SDK as a dependency to your Helm chart and package the Helm chart. See [Declare the SDK as a Dependency](replicated-sdk-using#declare-the-sdk-as-a-dependency) in _Using the SDK with Your Application (Beta)_.

1. Create an application or use an existing application in the vendor portal, and create a new release. See [Using the Vendor Portal](replicated-sdk-using#using-the-vendor-portal) in _Using the SDK with Your Application (Beta)_.

1. <PromoteUnstable/>

1. <LicenseCreate/>

1. <ImageRegistryConnect/>

1. Test your release with the Helm Installation. See [Installing an Application with Helm (Beta)](install-with-helm)

1. Validate that telemetry is showing up for the customer instance. Click through to the instance details and review the events. See [About Instance and Event Data](instance-insights-event-data).

After you install the first release for your application, return to the vendor portal to create a new release by adding SDK functionality. For more information, see [Add SDK Functionality](sdk-functionality-add)
