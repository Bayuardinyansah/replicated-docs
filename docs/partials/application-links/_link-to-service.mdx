To add a link to a service on the Admin Console dashboard:

1. In your release, configure the [`ports`](/reference/custom-resource-application#ports) key in the KOTS Application custom resource with details for the target service:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
   kind: Application
   metadata:
     name: my-application
   spec:
     ports:
       - serviceName: my-service
         servicePort: 9000
         localPort: 9000
         applicationUrl: "http://my-service"
   ```

   1. For `ports.serviceName`, add the name of the service.
   
   1. For `ports.servicePort`, add the `containerPort` of the Pod where the service is running.

      <ServicePortNote/>

   1. (Optional) For `ports.localPort` add the port to map on the local workstation. If not set, this is the same port as `servicePort`.

   1. For `ports.applicationURL`, add a URL. Consider the following guidelines:
      * Use HTTP instead of HTTPS unless TLS termination takes place in the application Pod.
      * You can use the name of the service as the hostname for the URL. For example, `http://my-service`. KOTS rewrites the URL with the hostname in the browser during deployment.

1. Configure a Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource in the release:

    ```yaml
    # app.k8s.io/v1beta1 Application Custom resource

    apiVersion: app.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Application
    metadata:
      name: "my-application"
    spec:
      descriptor:
        links:
          - description: Open App
            # url matches ports.applicationURL in the KOTS Application custom resource
            url: "http://my-service"
    ```

    1. For `spec.descriptor.links.description`, add the link text that will appear on the Admin Console dashboard. For example, `Open App`.

    1. For `spec.descriptor.links.url`, add the _same_ URL that you used in the `ports.applicationURL` in the KOTS Application custom resource.

1. Promote the release to the channel that you use for internal testing, then install in a development environment to test your changes.
