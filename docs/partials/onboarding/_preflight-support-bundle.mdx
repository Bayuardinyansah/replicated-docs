The Troubleshoot open-source project provides _preflight checks_ and _support bundles_.

#### Step 4a: Define Preflight Checks

Define preflight checks to test for system compliance during installation and upgrade to reduce the number of support escalations.

To define preflight checks:

1. In your Helm chart templates directory, add a Kubernetes Secret that includes the spec for preflight checks. See <a href="/vendor/preflight-defining">Defining Preflight Checks</a>.

1. Package your Helm chart then add the chart archive to a new release.

1. Install the release to test your changes.

#### Step 4b: Add Default Support Bundle Spec

Enable customers to quickly collect and analyze troubleshooting data from their clusters to help you diagnose problems with application deployments.

To add the default support bundle spec:

1. In your Helm chart `templates` directory, add the following YAML a Kubernetes Secret:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      labels:
        troubleshoot.sh/kind: support-bundle
      name: example
    stringData:
      support-bundle-spec: |
        apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
        kind: SupportBundle
        metadata:
          name: support-bundle
        spec:
          collectors: []
          analyzers: []
    ```

1. Package your Helm chart and add the chart archive to a new release.

1. Install the release to test your changes.
