<li><p>(Optional) <code>ports.applicationUrl</code>: When set to the same URL that is specified in the `descriptor.links.url` field of the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource, KOTS adds a link to the given service on the Admin Console dashboard. To construct this link during deployment, KOTS automatically rewrites the URL with the hostname in the browser and appends the specified port.
