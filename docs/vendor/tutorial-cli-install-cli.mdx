# CLI Tutorial

This tutorial helps you use replicated CLI and the Replicated app manager to quickly deploy, install, and iterate with a sample Kubernetes application using a CLI-based workflow.

## Step 1: Install the replicated CLI

To begin, install the replicated CLI to perform the deployment tasks.

To install the replicated CLI:

1. Use [homebrew](https://brew.sh) or the latest Linux or macOS version from [the replicatedhq/replicated releases page](https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated/releases) to install the CLI.

  ```shell script
  brew install replicatedhq/replicated/cli
  ```

1. Verify the installation using `replicated version`:

  ```text
  $ replicated version
  ```
  ```json
  {
    "version": "0.31.0",
    "git": "c67210a",
    "buildTime": "2020-09-03T18:31:11Z",
    "go": {
        "version": "go1.14.7",
        "compiler": "gc",
        "os": "darwin",
        "arch": "amd64"
    }
  }
  ``
