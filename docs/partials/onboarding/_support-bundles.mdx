Enable customers to quickly collect and analyze troubleshooting data from their clusters to help you diagnose problems with application deployments.

To add the default support bundle spec:

1. In your Helm chart `templates` directory, add the following YAML a Kubernetes Secret:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      labels:
        troubleshoot.sh/kind: support-bundle
      name: example
    stringData:
      support-bundle-spec: |
        apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
        kind: SupportBundle
        metadata:
          name: support-bundle
        spec:
          collectors: []
          analyzers: []
    ```

1. Package your Helm chart and add the chart archive to a new release.

1. Install the release to test your changes. See [Generating Support Bundles](/vendor/support-bundle-generating).

1. (Optional) Customize the support bundle spec by adding additional collectors and analyzers. You can also do this step later. See [(Optional) Customize the Specification](/vendor/support-bundle-customizing#optional-customize-the-specification) in _Adding and Customizing Support Bundles_.
