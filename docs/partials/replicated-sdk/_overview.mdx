The Replicated SDK is a Helm chart that can be installed as a small service alongside your application Helm chart. The Replicated SDK provides an in-cluster API that you can use to embed Replicated features into your application such as:

* Insights and operational telemetry for instances of your application running in customer environments, including support for collecting custom metrics. See [About Instance and Event Data](/vendor/instance-insights-event-data) and [Enabling and Understanding Application Status](insights-app-status).
* Support for checking customer license entitlements at runtime, including signature verification. See [Checking Entitlements for Helm Installations (Beta)](/vendor/licenses-reference-helm) and [Verifying License Field Signatures for Helm Installations (Beta)](/vendor/licenses-verify-fields-sdk-api). 
* Support for update checks to alert your customers when new versions of your application are available for upgrade. See [Support Update Checks in Your Admin Console](/reference/replicated-sdk-apis#support-update-checks-in-your-admin-console) in _Replicated SDK API (Beta)_.
