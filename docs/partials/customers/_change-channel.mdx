You can change the channel that a customer is assigned to at any time. When you change a customer's channel, the customer can synchronize their license in the Replicated admin console to fetch the latest release on the new channel and then upgrade. The admin console always fetches the latest release on the new channel, regardless of the presence of any releases on the channel that are marked as required.
