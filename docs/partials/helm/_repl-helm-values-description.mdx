When a customer installs your Helm chart from the Replicated registry, the Replicated registry injects values into the `global.replicated` field of the Helm chart values file.

The following is an example of a Helm values file containing the `global.replicated` field injected by the Replicated registry:

```yaml
# Helm values.yaml
global:
  replicated:
    channelName: Stable
    customerEmail: username@example.com
    customerName: Example Customer
    dockerconfigjson: eyJhdXRocyI6eyJd1dIRk5NbEZFVGsxd2JGUmFhWGxYWm5scloyNVRSV1pPT2pKT2NGaHhUVEpSUkU1...
    licenseFields:
      expires_at:
        description: License Expiration
        name: expires_at
        signature:
          v1: iZBpESXx7fpdtnbMKingYHiJH42rP8fPs0x8izy1mODckGBwVoA... 
        title: Expiration
        value: "2023-05-30T00:00:00Z"
        valueType: String
    licenseID: YiIXRTjiB7R...
    licenseType: dev
```

The values in the `global.replicated` field provide information about the following:
* Details about the fields in the customer's license, such as the field name, description, signature, value, and any custom license fields that you define. You can use this license information to check license entitlments before the application is installed. For more information, see [Check Entitlements Before Installation](/vendor/licenses-reference-helm#before-install) in _Checking Entitlements for Helm Installations_.
* A base64 encoded Docker configuration file. To proxy images from an external private registry with the Replicated proxy service, you can use the `global.replicated.dockerconfigjson` field to create an image pull secret for the proxy service. For more information, see [Proxying Images for Helm Installations](/vendor/helm-image-registry).
