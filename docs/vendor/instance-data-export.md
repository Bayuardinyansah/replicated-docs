# Download Customer and Instance Data

This topic describes how to download and export customer and instance data from the Replicated vendor portal.

## Overview

While you can always consume customer and instance insight data directly in the Replicated vendor portal, the data is also available in a CSV format so that it can be imported into any other system, such as:
* Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems like Salesforce or Gainsight
* Data warehouses like Redshift, Snowflake, or BigQuery
* Business intelligence (BI) tools like Looker, Tableau, or PowerBI

In making this data available for your customer instances, you can make better decisions about where to focus your efforts across product, sales, engineering, and customer success.
