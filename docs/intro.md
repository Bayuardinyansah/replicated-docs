# Welcome

Welcome! This topic describes how to get started with Replicated as a software vendor. It also includes information on how to navigate the Replicated product documentation site.

## Get Started with Replicated

The documentation includes UI-based and CLI-based tutorials that are designed to help software vendors learn about Replicated by completing common tasks with a sample application. Replicated strongly recommends that you complete both of the following tutorials before you get started implementing features with your own application:

* **Vendor Portal and Admin Console UI Tutorial**: Shows how to use the Replicated vendor portal to create and promote releases, then install with the Replicated admin console. See [Introduction and Setup](/vendor/tutorial-ui-setup) in _UI Tutorial_.
* **replicated CLI and kots CLI Tutorial**: Shows how to use the replicated CLI to create and promote releases, then install with the Replicated kots CLI. See [Introduction and Setup](/vendor/tutorial-cli-setup) in _CLI Tutorial_.

## About the Replicated Documentation

The Replicated product documentation includes information about the Replicated features for application vendors and for their enterprise end users.

### Distribute and Support (Vendor)

The _Distribute and Support_ section includes documentation for application vendors. This section describes how to package, distribute, and support an application with the Replicated app manager. It includes information about managing channels, releases, and customers in the Replicated vendor portal. It also describes how to configure features such as preflight checks, support bundles, backup and restore, and Kubernetes installers for your application. For more information, see [What is Replicated?](intro-replicated) and [How to Create Releases for Your Application](/vendor/distributing-workflow).

### Install and Manage (Enterprise User)

The _Install and Manage_ section includes documentation for the enterprise users of applications distributed with Replicated. This section describes how to use the Replicated admin console and the Replicated kots CLI to install, update, manage, back up and restore, and monitor application instances. For more information, see [About Installing an Application](/enterprise/installing-overview).

Vendors can use the documentation in this section to test the installation and management of their application with the admin console and kots CLI.

Vendors can also use the content in this section to write their own documentation for their applications. For more information about writing documentation, see the [replicated-docs](https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated-docs) repository in GitHub.
