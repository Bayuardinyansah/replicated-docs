# Step 5: Create a Customer

After creating a release, you must create a customer object.
A customer represents a single licensed end user of your application.

In this example, create a customer named `Some Big Bank` with an expiration in 10 days.

To create a customer license:

1. Run the following command to create the customer and assign them to a channel. For this example, since you created your release on the Unstable channel, assign the customer to the same channel:

  ```shell script
  replicated customer create \
    --name "Some-Big-Bank" \
    --expires-in "240h" \
    --channel "Unstable"
  ```

  **Example output:**

  ```text
  ID                             NAME             CHANNELS     EXPIRES                          TYPE
  1h0yojS7MmpAUcZk8ekt7gn0M4q    Some-Big-Bank     Unstable    2020-09-13 19:48:00 +0000 UTC    dev
  ```

1. Run the following command to verify the customer creation details:

  ```text
  replicated customer ls
  ```

1. Run the following command to download a license file:

  ```shell script
  replicated customer download-license \
    --customer "Some-Big-Bank"
  ```

1. Because the license downloads to `stdout`, run the following command if you want to redirect the output to a file:

  ```shell script
  export LICENSE_FILE=~/Desktop/Some-Big-Bank-${REPLICATED_APP}-license.yaml
  replicated customer download-license --customer "Some-Big-Bank" > "${LICENSE_FILE}"
  ```

1. Verify the license was written properly using either `cat` or `head`:

  ```text
  $ head ${LICENSE_FILE}

  apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
  kind: License
  metadata:
    name: some-big-bank
  spec:
    appSlug: kots-dex
    channelName: Unstable
    customerName: Some-Big-Bank
    endpoint: https://replicated.app
  ```
