# Replicated Quick Start

Welcome! This topic provides an onboarding workflow and a feature checklist to help you get started with the Replicated Platform. For more information about Replicated, see [Introduction to Replicated](../intro-replicated).

## Objectives

The goals of this quick start are to introduce new Replicated users to the following common tasks for the purpose of preparing to onboard to the Replicated Platform:

* Working with _applications_, _channels_, _releases_, and _customers_ in the Replicated Vendor Portal

* Working with the Replicated CLI

* Installing and updating releases using Helm

## Set Up the Environment

Before you begin, do the following to set up your environment:

* Ensure that you have kubectl access to a Kubernetes cluster. You can use any cloud provider or tool that you prefer to create a cluster, such as [Replicated Compatibility Matrix](/vendor/testing-how-to), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), or minikube.

* Install the Helm CLI. To install the Helm CLI using Homebrew, run: 

   ```
   brew install helm
   ```

   For more information, including alternative installation options, see [Install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) in the Helm documentation.

## Quick Start

This workflow shows how to create, install, and update releases for a sample Helm chart in the Replicated Platform. You will repeat these same basic steps to create and test releases throughout the onboarding process to integrate Replicated features with your own application.

1. Create an account in the Vendor Portal. You can either create a new team or join an existing team. For more information, see [Creating a Vendor Account](vendor-portal-creating-account).

1. Create an application using the Replicated CLI:

   1. On your local machine, install the Replicated CLI:

      ```bash
      brew install replicatedhq/replicated/cli
      ```
      For more installation options, see [Installing the Replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).

   1. Authorize the Replicated CLI:

      ```bash
      replicated login
      ```
      In the browser window that opens, complete the prompts to log in to your Vendor Portal account and authorize the CLI.

   1. Create an application named `Gitea`:

      ```bash
      replicated app create Gitea
      ```

   1. Set the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable to the application that you created. This allows you to interact with the application using the Replicated CLI without needing to use the `--app` flag with every command:

      1. Get the slug for the application that you created:

         ```bash
         replicated app ls
         ```
         **Example output**:
         ```bash
         ID                             NAME            SLUG           SCHEDULER
         2WthxUIfGT13RlrsUx9HR7So8bR    Gitea           gitea-kite     kots
         ```
         In the example above, the application slug is `gitea-kite`.

      1. Set the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable to the application slug.

         **Example:**

         ```bash
         export REPLICATED_APP=gitea-kite
         ```

1. Get the sample Bitnami Gitea Helm chart and add the Replicated SDK as a dependency:

   1. Run the following command to pull and untar version 1.0.6 of the Bitnami Gitea Helm chart:

      ```
      helm pull --untar oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/gitea --version 1.0.6
      ```
      For more information about this chart, see the [bitnami/gitea](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/gitea) repository in GitHub.

   1. Change to the new `gitea` directory that was created:
      
      ```bash
      cd gitea
      ```

   1. In the Helm chart `Chart.yaml`, add the Replicated SDK as a dependency:

      <DependencyYaml/>

      The Replicated SDK is a Helm chart that provides access to Replicated features and can be installed as a small service alongside your application. For more information, see [About the Replicated SDK](/vendor/replicated-sdk-overview).

   1. Update dependencies and package the Helm chart to a `.tgz` chart archive:

      <HelmPackage/>

1. Add the chart archive to a release and promote the release to the Unstable channel:
   
     ```bash
     replicated release create --chart=gitea-1.0.6.tgz --promote=Unstable
     ```
     **Example output**:
     ```bash
     You are creating a release that will only be installable with the helm CLI.
     For more information, see
     https://docs.replicated.com/vendor/helm-install#about-helm-installations-with-replicated

     • Reading chart from gitea-1.0.6.tgz ✓
     • Creating Release ✓
       • SEQUENCE: 1
     • Promoting ✓
       • Channel 2kvspHtBIWqsNORGJw4KDv3L8eI successfully set to release 1
     ```

1. Create a customer so that you can install the release in your cluster:

   1. In the [Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com), click **Customers > Create customer**.

      The **Create a new customer** page opens:

      ![Customer a new customer page in the Vendor Portal](/images/create-customer.png)

      [View a larger version of this image](/images/create-customer.png)

   1. For **Customer name**, enter a name for the customer. For example, `Example Customer`.

   1. For **Channel**, select **Unstable**. This allows the customer to install releases promoted to the Unstable channel.

   1. For **License type**, select **Development**.

   1. For **Customer email**, enter an email address. An email address is required for Helm installations to authenticate with the Replicated registry. This email address is never used to send emails to customers.

   1. Click **Save Changes**.

   For more information, see [Creating and Managing Customers](/vendor/releases-creating-customer).

1. Install the application:

   1. Create a `gitea` namespace for the installation:

      ```
      kubectl create namespace gitea
      ```

   1. Update the current kubectl context to target the new `gitea` namespace. This ensures that the chart is installed in the `gitea` namespace without requiring you to set the `--namespace` flag with the `helm install` command:

      ```
      kubectl config set-context --namespace=gitea --current
      ```

   1. In the Vendor Portal, on the page for the customer that you created, click **Helm Install Instructions**.
   
   1. Run the commands in the **Helm install instructions** dialog to log in to the Replicated registry and install the chart in your cluster. Skip the steps to run preflight checks and install the Replicated SDK in integration mode.

      <img alt="Helm install instructions dialog" src="/images/helm-install-instructions-no-preflights.png" width="500px"/>
     
      [View a larger image](/images/helm-install-instructions-no-preflights.png)

      :::note
      Ignore the **No preflight checks found** warning. This warning appears because there are no specifications for preflight checks in the Helm chart archive. You will add preflight checks later.
      ::: 

   1. After the installation command completes, you can see that both the `gitea` Deployment and the Replicated SDK `replicated` Deployment were created:

      ```
      kubectl get deploy
      ```
      **Example output:**
      ```
      NAME         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
      gitea        0/1     1            0           35s
      replicated   1/1     1            1           35s
      ```   

   1. Watch the `gitea` LoadBalancer service until an external IP is available:

      ```
      kubectl get svc gitea --watch
      ```

   1. After an external IP address is available for the `gitea` LoadBalancer service, confirm that you can open the application in a browser by going to `http://SERVICE_IP`, where `SERVICE_IP` is the external IP address for the `gitea` LoadBalancer service.

       [View a larger version of this image](/images/gitea-app.png)   

1. View instance insights for the installation:

   1. Return to the Vendor Portal and go to **Customers**. Under the name of the customer, confirm that you can see an active instance.

     This instance telemetry is automatically collected and sent back to the Vendor Portal when the Replicated SDK is installed alongside the application. For more information, see [About Instance and Event Data](/vendor/instance-insights-event-data).

   1. Under **Instance ID**, click on the ID to view additional insights including the versions of Kubernetes and the Replicated SDK running in the cluster where you installed the application. For more information, see [Instance Details](/vendor/instance-insights-details).

1. Create a new release that adds preflight checks to the application:

   1. In your local filesystem, go to the `gitea` directory.

   1. Create a `gitea-preflights.yaml` file in the `templates` directory:

      ```
      touch templates/gitea-preflights.yaml
      ```

   1. In the `gitea-preflights.yaml` file, add the following YAML to create a Kubernetes Secret with a simple preflight spec: 

      ```yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Secret
      metadata:
        labels:
          troubleshoot.sh/kind: preflight
        name: "{{ .Release.Name }}-preflight-config"
      stringData:
        preflight.yaml: |
          apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
          kind: Preflight
          metadata:
            name: preflight-sample
          spec:
            collectors:
              - http:
                  collectorName: slack
                  get:
                    url: https://api.slack.com/methods/api.test
            analyzers:
              - textAnalyze:
                  checkName: Slack Accessible
                  fileName: slack.json
                  regex: '"status": 200,'
                  outcomes:
                    - pass:
                        when: "true"
                        message: "Can access the Slack API"
                    - fail:
                        when: "false"
                        message: "Cannot access the Slack API. Check that the server can reach the internet and check [status.slack.com](https://status.slack.com)."
      ```
      The YAML above defines a preflight check that confirms that an HTTP request to the Slack API at `https://api.slack.com/methods/api.test` made from the cluster returns a successful response of `"status": 200,`.

   1. In the `Chart.yaml` file, increment the version to 1.0.7:

      ```yaml
      # Chart.yaml
      version: 1.0.7
      ```

   1. Update dependencies and package the chart to a `.tgz` chart archive:

      ```bash
      helm package . --dependency-update
      ```
   
   1. Create and promote a new release with the `gitea-1.0.7.tgz` archive:

      ```bash
      replicated release create --chart=gitea-1.0.7.tgz --promote Unstable
      ```
      **Example output**:
      ```bash
      You are creating a release that will only be installable with the helm CLI.
      For more information, see
      https://docs.replicated.com/vendor/helm-install#about-helm-installations-with-replicated

      • Reading chart from gitea-1.0.7.tgz ✓
      • Creating Release ✓
        • SEQUENCE: 2
      • Promoting ✓
        • Channel 2kvspHtBIWqsNORGJw4KDv3L8eI successfully set to release 2
      ```

1. Upgrade to the new version:

   1. In the Vendor Portal, open the **Helm Install Instructions** for the customer again.

      The **Helm Install Instructions** dialog now includes steps for installing the preflight plugin and running preflight checks.

      <img alt="Helm install instructions with preflight commands" src="/images/helm-install-instructions-preflights.png" width="550px"/>

      [View a larger version of this command](/images/helm-install-instructions-preflights.png)
   
   1. Run the first command to log in to the registry.
   
   1. Run the second command to install the preflight plugin.
   
   1. Run the third command to run preflight checks.

      The results of the preflight checks are displayed in the CLI.

   1. Instead of running the install command, use Helm to upgrade the instance to the new release that you just promoted. The `helm upgrade` command is the same as the `helm install` command, replacing `install` with `upgrade`:

      ```
      helm upgrade gitea oci://registry.replicated.com/gitea/unstable/gitea
      ```

      See [Helm Upgrade](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) in the Helm documentation.

   1. After the upgrade completes, return to the **Instance details** page in the Vendor Portal and confirm that you can see the new 1.0.7 application version.

1. Uninstall the Helm chart and the Replicated SDK from your cluster:

   ```
   helm uninstall gitea
   ```

1. Delete the `gitea` namespace:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete namespace gitea
   ````

Now that you are familiar with the workflow of creating, installing, and updating releases, you can begin onboarding your own application to the Replicated Platform.

## Onboard

This section provides information about how to onboard your application to the Replicated platform by integrating various Replicated features. 

### Best Practices and Recommendations

The following are some best practices and recommendations for successfully onboarding with Replicated:

* When integrating new Replicated features with an application, make changes in small iterations and test frequently by installing or upgrading the application in a development environment. This will help you to more easily identify issues and troubleshoot.

* Use the Replicated CLI to create and manage your application and releases. Getting familiar with the Replicated CLI will help later on when integrating Replicated workflows into your CI/CD pipelines. For more information, see [Installing the Replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).

* Ask for help from the Replicated community. For more information, see [Get Help from the Community](#get-help-from-the-community).

* Replicated also offers labs in Instruqt that provide a hands-on introduction to working with Replicated features, without needing your own sample application or development environment. To complete one or more labs before you begin the onboarding workflow, see:
  * [Distributing Your Application with Replicated](https://play.instruqt.com/embed/replicated/tracks/distributing-with-replicated?token=em_VHOEfNnBgU3auAnN): Learn how to quickly get value from the Replicated Platform for your application.
  * [Avoiding Installation Pitfalls](https://play.instruqt.com/embed/replicated/tracks/avoiding-installation-pitfalls?token=em_gJjtIzzTTtdd5RFG): Learn how to use preflight checks to avoid common installation issues and assure your customer is installing into a supported environment.
  * [Closing the Support Information Gap](https://play.instruqt.com/embed/replicated/tracks/closing-information-gap?token=em_MO2XXCz3bAgwtEca): Learn how to use support bundles to close the information gap between your customers and your support team.

### Onboarding Checklist

This section provides a checklist of key Replicated features to integrate with your application to fully onboard onto the Replicated Platform. These features are provided in a suggested order, though you can configure and test the features in any order.
