Using custom domains has the following limitations:

- A single custom domain cannot be used for multiple endpoints. For example, a single domain can map to `registry.replicated.com` for any number of applications, but cannot map to both `registry.replicated.com` and `proxy.replicated.com`, even if the applications are different.

- Custom domains cannot be used to alias api.replicated.com (platform market API) or other services.

- Multiple custom domains can be configured, but only one custom domain can be the default for each Replicated endpoint. All configured custom domains work whether or not they are the default.
