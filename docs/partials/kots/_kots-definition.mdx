Replicated KOTS is a kubectl plugin that provides highly successful installs of Helm charts and Kubernetes applications into customer-controlled environments, including on-prem and air gap environments. For users that have less experience with Kubernetes, KOTS supports installations onto VMs or bare metal servers through embedded clusters, which are provisioned in the customer environment at the time of installation.
