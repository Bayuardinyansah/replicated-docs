# About the Replicated Proxy Service

This topic describes how the Replicated proxy service can be used to grant proxy access to your application's private images.

## Overview

If your application images are available in a private image registry exposed to the internet, such as Docker Hub or Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), then the Replicated proxy service can grant proxy, or _pull-through_, access to the images without exposing registry credentials to your customers. When you use the proxy service, you do not have to modify the process that you already use to build and push images to deploy your application.

To grant proxy access, the proxy service uses the customer licenses that you create in the Replicated vendor portal. This allows you to revoke a customerâ€™s ability to pull private images by editing their license, rather than having to manage image access through separate identity or authentication systems. For example, when a trial license expires, the customer's ability to pull private images is automatically revoked.

The following diagram demonstrates how the proxy service pulls images from your external registry, and how deployed instances of your application pull images from the proxy service:

## About Enabling the Proxy Service

This section describes how to enable the proxy service.

### Registry Credentials

The proxy service requires read-only credentials to the private image registry in order to grant proxy access to the images.

For more information, see [Add Credentials for an External Registry](packaging-private-images#add-credentials-for-an-external-registry) in _Connecting to an External Registry_.
### Image Location and Pull Secret

To use the proxy service, your application must provide:

* The URL where the image can be accessed (at either the `proxy.replicated.com` domain or a custom domain).
* An image pull secret with `type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`

### Custom Domains

By default, the proxy service uses the `proxy.registry.com` domain. You can optionally use a custom domain for the proxy service instead of `proxy.replicated.com`. See [Using Custom Domains](custom-domains-using).

<!-- ### Helm CLI Installations

Create the image pull secret using the `global.replicated.dockerconfigjson` value that is automatically injected into the Helm chart `values.yaml` during installation.

For more information, see [Proxying Images for Helm Installations](helm-image-registry). -->

<!-- ## Enable the Proxy Service

To enable the proxy service:

1. Add read-only credentials to your private registry. See [Connecting to an External Registry](packaging-private-images).

1. (Optional) Set up a custom domain for the proxy service to be used instead of `proxy.replicated.com`. See [Using Custom Domains](custom-domains-using).

1. Ensure that image names are rewritten to the location where the image can be accessed (at either the `proxy.replicated.com` domain or a custom domain) and that the required image pull secret is provided. The required steps vary based on your application type and deployment method:
   * **Standard manifests deployed with KOTS and Helm Charts Deployed with KOTS HelmChart v1 custom resource**: KOTS automatically rewrites image names and creates the secret during deployment. No additional configuration is required.
     KOTS does not patch the image location URL for images hosted on the Replicated registry at `registry.replicated.com`. However, KOTS adds the same `imagePullSecret` to PodSpecs that reference images in the Replicated registry. For more information about using the Replicated registry, see [Using the Replicated Registry for KOTS Installations](private-images-replicated).
   * **Helm Charts deployed with KOTS HelmChart v2 Custom Resource**: Configure the HelmChart v2 custom resource to dynamically update image names in your Helm chart and to inject the image pull secret. For more information, see [Configuring the HelmChart Custom Resource v2](/vendor/helm-native-v2-using).
   * **Helm Charts deployed with the Helm CLI**: Create the image pull secret using the `global.replicated.dockerconfigjson` value that is automatically injected into the Helm chart `values.yaml` during installation. For more information, see [Proxying Images for Helm Installations](helm-image-registry).

1. (KOTS Only) If you are deploying Pods to namespaces other than the application namespace, add the namespace to the `additionalNamespaces` attribute of the KOTS Application custom resource. This ensures that KOTS can provision the `imagePullSecret` in the namespace to allow the Pod to pull the image. See [Defining Additional Namespaces](operator-defining-additional-namespaces). -->
