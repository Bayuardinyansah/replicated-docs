The Replicated SDK is a Helm chart that can be installed as a small service alongside your application. The SDK can be installed alongside Helm chart- or standard manifest-based applications using the Helm CLI or KOTS. Replicated recommends that the SDK is distributed with all applications because it provides access to key Replicated functionality.

For information about how to distribute and install the SDK with your application, see [Installing the Replicated SDK](/vendor/replicated-sdk-installing).

The SDK automatically provides access to insights and operational telemetry for instances running in customer environments. For more information, see [About Instance and Event Data](/vendor/instance-insights-event-data) and [Enabling and Understanding Application Status](insights-app-status).

Addtionally, the Replicated SDK provides an in-cluster API that you can use to embed Replicated features into your application such as:
* Collect custom metrics on instances running in online or air gap environments. See [Configuring Custom Metrics](/vendor/custom-metrics).
* Check customer license entitlements at runtime, including signature verification. See [Checking Entitlements for Helm Installations (Beta)](/vendor/licenses-reference-helm) and [Verifying License Field Signatures for Helm Installations (Beta)](/vendor/licenses-verify-fields-sdk-api). 
* Provide update checks to alert your customers when new versions of your application are available for upgrade. See [Support Update Checks in Your Admin Console](/reference/replicated-sdk-apis#support-update-checks-in-your-admin-console) in _Replicated SDK API (Beta)_.
