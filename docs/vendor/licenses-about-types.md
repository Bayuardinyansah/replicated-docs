# Community Licenses

This topic describes community licenses and how to update the type of a license.

## Overview

Community licenses are intended for use with a free or low cost version of your application. For example, you could use community licenses for an open source version of your application.

After installing an application with a community license, users can change their community license to a different type of license. Because several of your community users might use the same community license, this allows you to upgrade a single user to a new license without changing the community license for all users. This also allows you to upgrade a user from a shared community license without requiring them to reinstall the application.

For more information, see [Change Community Licenses](/enterprise/updating-licenses#change-community-licenses) in _Updating Licenses_. 

## Limitations

Community licenses function in the same way as the other types of licenses, with the following
exceptions:

* Updating a community license to another type of license cannot be reverted.
* Community license users are not supported by the Replicated Support team.
* Community licenses cannot support air gapped installations.
* Community licenses cannot include an expiration date.
* For applications installed with Replicated KOTS, the branding in the Replicated admin console for community users differs in the following ways:
  * The license tile on the admin console **Dashboard** page is highlighted in yellow and with the words **Community Edition**.
