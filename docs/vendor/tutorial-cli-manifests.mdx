# Step 3: Get the Sample Manifests

To create a release with the replicated CLI, you must have the YAML manifest files for the application in a directory.
This step shows you how to download sample manifest files from https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated-starter-kots and initialize a Git repository for the sample application.

To get the sample YAML files and initialize the application repository:

1. Run the following command to create a folder for your project:

  ```shell script
  mkdir replicated-cli-tutorial
  cd replicated-cli-tutorial
  ```

1. Run the following command to make a folder for the application manifests and download the starter YAML from https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated-starter-kots:

  ```shell script
  mkdir ./manifests
  curl -fSsL https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots-default-yaml/archive/v2020-09-03.tar.gz | \
    tar xzv --strip-components=1 -C ./manifests \
    --exclude README.md --exclude LICENSE --exclude .gitignore
  ```

  :::note
  If you are using Helm charts to package your application, you can explore [Creating a release from an existing Helm chart](helm-overview) for steps on how to add the required app manager YAML files to your Helm chart after you finish reviewing this tutorial.

  You should now have a few YAML files in the manifests folder:

  ** Example:**

  ```text
  $ ls -la manifests
  .rw-r--r--  114 dex 16 Aug  7:59 config-map.yaml
  .rw-r--r--  906 dex 16 Aug  7:59 config.yaml
  .rw-r--r--  608 dex 16 Aug  7:59 deployment.yaml
  .rw-r--r--  296 dex 16 Aug  7:59 ingress.yaml
  .rw-r--r-- 2.5k dex 16 Aug  7:59 preflight.yaml
  .rw-r--r--  399 dex 16 Aug  7:59 replicated-app.yaml
  .rw-r--r--  205 dex 16 Aug  7:59 service.yaml
  .rw-r--r--  355 dex 16 Aug  7:59 support-bundle.yaml
  ```

1. Run the following command to verify this YAML:

  ```shell script
  $ replicated release lint --yaml-dir=manifests
  ```

  If there are no errors, an empty list is displayed with a zero exit code.

  **Example output:**

  ```text
  RULE    TYPE    FILENAME    LINE    MESSAGE
  ```

1. Initialize this project as a Git repository so that you can track your history.
Additionally, the replicated CLI reads git metadata to help with the generation of release metadata,
such as version labels. More information about this is covered later in this tutorial.

  To initialize the repository, run the following commands:

  ```shell script
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial Commit: CLI Quickstart"
