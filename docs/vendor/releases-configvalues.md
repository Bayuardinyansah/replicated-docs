# Downloading the ConfigValues File

This topic describes how to access and download the ConfigValues file for an installed application instance so that you can share the file with your users.

## About ConfigValues Files

A ConfigValues file is a YAML manifest file that defines the user-supplied configuration values for an application. To configure an application using the kots CLI rather than using the Replicated admin console Config page, users must provide a ConfigValues file when they run the `kots install` command.

During application installation, the app manager reads the values provided in the ConfigValues file to configure the application. For more information about how users provide a ConfigValues file when installing with the kots CLI, see [Using Automation to Install on an Existing Cluster](/enterprise/installing-existing-cluster-automation) in the _Enterprise_ section.

The following is an example of a ConfigValues file:

<ConfigValuesExample/>

As shown in the example above, the ConfigValues file includes the names of configuration fields along with a user-supplied value for each field. Where applicable, the ConfigValues file can also include the default values of the configuration fields.

In the ConfigValues file, users can include any optional or required configuration fields that you defined in the Config custom resource for the release. For any required configuration fields that do not have a default value, users must provide a value in the ConfigValues file to install the application.

For more information about how to create custom configuration fields for your application in the Config custom resource, see [Config](/reference/custom-resource-config) in _Reference_.

## Download the ConfigValues File

During application installation, the Replicated app manager automatically generates a ConfigValues file and saves the file in a directory called `upstream`. After installing an application, you can view this generated ConfigValues file in the admin console View files page. You can also download the file using the kots CLI.

To allow your users to install and configure your application with the kots CLI, Replicated recommends that you provide your users with an example of an accurate ConfigValues file that they can copy and paste. To create this example, you can use the ConfigValues file generated by the app manager for an instance of your application that you installed in a development environment.

To download the ConfigValues file for an installed instance of your application:

1. Install the desired release for your application in a development environment. For more information, see [Installing on an Existing Cluster](/enterprise/installing-existing-cluster) or [Installing with the Kubernetes Installer](/enterprise/installing-embedded-cluster).

1. Run the following command to download the manifest files for the installed instance of the application:

    ```
    kubectl kots download --namespace APP_NAMESPACE --slug APP_SLUG --decrypt-password-values
    ```
    Replace:
    * `APP_NAMESPACE` with the namespace on the cluster where you installed your application.
    * `APP_SLUG` with the slug of the application.

    The app manager downloads your application files from the cluster. The output of this command provides the location of the downloaded files in your local directory.

    :::note
    The `--decrypt-password-values` flag decrypts all configuration fields with `type: password`. In the downloaded ConfigValues file, the decrypted value is stored in a `valuePlaintext` field.
    :::

1. In your local directory, navigate to the location where the app manager downloaded the files. Open the ConfigValues file located at `upstream/userdata/config.yaml` in a text editor.

1. Copy and paste the contents of the ConfigValues file to a new file to create an example for your users. Consider the following recommendations for the example ConfigValues file:
   * Indicate which configuration fields are required and optional. For any required configuration fields that do not have a default value, users must provide a value in the ConfigValues file to install the application.
   * Where applicable, provide the default values for the configuration fields. In the ConfigValues file generated by the app manager, the default values are listed in the `default` fields.
   * The ConfigValues file generated by the app manager includes `metadata` and `status` fields. Users are not required to include the `metadata` or `status` fields in the ConfigValues file that they provide when installing with the kots CLI. You can remove these fields from the example ConfigValues that you provide to your users.
