Complete the following items before you create the first release for your application:

- Ensure that you have a Kubernetes application or Helm chart that includes at least one Deployment and one Service. Replicated recommends that you architect the application to deploy into a single namespace. For more information, see [Application Namespaces](namespaces).
- Set up or make sure that you have access to a development server that you can use to install and test each release.
- Create an account in the Replicated vendor portal. See [Creating a Vendor Account](vendor-portal-creating-account).
- Create a team in the vendor portal. See [Managing Team Members](team-management).
- (Recommended) To help you plan, Replicated recommends that you send a questionnaire to your customers to gather information about their environments. See [Customer Application Deployment Questionnaire](planning-questionnaire).
