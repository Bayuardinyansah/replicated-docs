# Getting Started Release Workflow

The following workflow helps you get started with your first release and understand how to navigate the documentation.

To get started with your first release:

1. Create a vendor account. See [Creating a Vendor Account](vendor-portal-creating-account).
1. Invite members to your team and manage permissions. See [Managing Team Members](team-management).
1. Connect to an image registry. See [COnnecting to an Image Registry](packaging-private-images).
1. Create a release with your application files. See [Managing Releases with the Vendor Portal](releases-creating-releases) or [Managing Releases with the CLI](releases-creating-cli).
1. Promote the release to a channel. See [Managing Releases with the Vendor Portal](releases-creating-releases) or [Managing Releases with the CLI](releases-creating-cli)
1. Create a customer to define a license file. See [Creating and Managing Customers](releases-creating-customer).
1. Test your installation:

    - For SDK installations using integration mode in a local environment with mock data, see [Developing Against the SDK API (Alpha)](replicated-sdk-development).
    - For KOTS and kURL installations, see [About Installing an Application](installing-overview) in the KOTS documentation.
    - For Helm installations, see [Installing an Application with Helm (Beta)](install-with-helm).
