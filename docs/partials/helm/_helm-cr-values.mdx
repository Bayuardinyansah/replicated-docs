The `values` key allows for values to be changed in the chart. It also can create a mapping between the Replicated admin console configuration screen and the values. This mapping makes it possible to use the configuration screen in the admin console to control the Helm `values.yaml` file. For more information about the configuration screen, see [About the Configuration Screen](../vendor/config-screen-about).

The keys below `values` must map exactly to the keys in your `values.yaml`.
Only include the keys below `values` that you want to change. These are merged with the `values.yaml` in the chart archive.

To exclude a value that is set in the Helm chart `values.yaml`, set the value equal to the string `"null"` (with quotes) in the `values` section of the HelmChart custom resource.

For more options, see the [Allow deletion of a previous values file key](https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/2648) pull request in the Helm repository in GitHub.
