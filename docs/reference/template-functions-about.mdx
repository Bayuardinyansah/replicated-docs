# About Template Functions

This topic describes Replicated KOTS template functions, including information about use cases, template function contexts, syntax.

## Overview

For Kubernetes manifest files for applications deployed by Replicated KOTS, Replicated provides a set of custom template functions based on the Go text/template library. 

<UseCases/>

All functionality of the Go templating language, including if statements, loops, and variables, is supported with KOTS template functions. For more information about the Go library, see [text/template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) in the Go documentation.

### Supported File Types

You can use KOTS template functions in any Kubernetes manifest files for applications deployed by KOTS, such as:
* Custom resources in the `kots.io` API group like Application, Config, or HelmChart
  :::note
  Not all fields in the Config custom resource support templating. For more information, see [Item Properties](/reference/custom-resource-config#item-properties) in _Config_.
  :::
* Custom resources in other API groups like Preflight, SupportBundle, or Backup
* Kubernetes objects like Deployments, Services, Secrets, or ConfigMaps
* Kubernetes Operators

### Helm Charts

KOTS template functions are _not_ directly supported in Helm charts. However, the HelmChart custom resource provides a way to map values rendered by KOTS template functions to Helm chart values. This allows you to use KOTS template functions with Helm charts without making changes to those Helm charts.

For information about how to map values from the HelmChart custom resource to Helm chart `values.yaml` files, see [Setting Helm Chart Values with KOTS](/vendor/helm-optional-value-keys).

### Template Function Rendering

During application installation and upgrade, KOTS templates all Kubernetes manifest files in a release (except for the Config custom resource) at the same time during a single process.

For the Config custom resource, KOTS templates each item separately. This means that variables or generated values such as [RandomString](/reference/template-functions-static-context#randomstring) cannot be referenced across different items because they are evaluated separately for each item. For information about the Config custom resource, see [Config](/reference/custom-resource-config).

## Syntax {#syntax}

The KOTS template function syntax supports the following functionally equivalent delimiters:
* [`repl{{ ... }}`](#syntax-integer)
* [`{{repl ... }}`](#syntax-string)

### `repl{{ ... }}` {#syntax-integer}

This syntax renders string, boolean, or integer values and can be used at the beginning, middle, or end of a value in YAML. This syntax _cannot_ be wrapped in quotes because any quotation marks are stripped during rendering.

For example:

```yaml
replicas: repl{{ ConfigOption "replicas" }}
```
The template function above renders an integer:

```yaml
replicas: 5
```

For more examples, see [Template Function Examples](/reference/template-functions-examples).

### `{{repl ... }}` {#syntax-string}

This syntax renders string, boolean, or integer values and can be used at the middle or end of a value in YAML.

This syntax supports being wrapped in quotes, if you need the rendered result of the template function to be quoted. When wrapped in quotes, this syntax returns string values only.

To use this syntax at the beginning of a value in YAML, it _must_ be wrapped in quotes because you cannot start a YAML value with the `{` character.

#### Example Without Quotes

```yaml
links:
  - description: "Click Me"
    url: https://{{repl ConfigOption "hostname"}}:{{repl ConfigOption "port"}}
```

#### Example With Quotes

The following example is wrapped in quotes because it is used at the beginning of a statement in YAML:

```yaml
env:
  - name: MAX_CONCURRENT_USERS
    value: '{{repl LicenseFieldValue "max_concurrent_users"}}'
```
The template function above renders a string:

```yaml
env:
  - name: MAX_CONCURRENT_USERS
    value: '100'
```

For more examples, see [Template Function Examples](/reference/template-functions-examples).

## Contexts {#contexts}

KOTS template functions are grouped into different contexts, depending on the phase of the application lifecycle when the function is available and the context of the data that is provided.

### Static Context

The context necessary to render the static template functions is always available.

The static context also includes the Masterminds Sprig function library. For more information, see [Sprig Function Documentation](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) on the sprig website.

For a list of all KOTS template functions available in the static context, see [Static context](template-functions-static-context).

### Config Context

Template functions in the config context are available when rendering an application that includes a Config custom resource.
At execution time, template functions in the config context also can use the static context functions.

For a list of all KOTS template functions available in the config context, see [Config context](template-functions-config-context).

### License Context

Template functions in the license context have access to customer license and version data.

For a list of all KOTS template functions available in the license context, see [License context](template-functions-license-context).

### kURL Context

Template functions in the kURL context have access to information about applications installed in embedded clusters created by Replicated kURL.

For a list of all KOTS template functions available in the kURL context, see [kURL context](template-functions-kurl-context).

### Identity Context

Template functions in the Identity context have access to Replicated identity service information.

For a list of all KOTS template functions available in the identity context, see [Identity context](template-functions-identity-context).
