1. Return to the Vendor Portal and go to **Customers**. Under the name of the customer, confirm that you can see an active instance.

     This instance telemetry is automatically collected and sent back to the Vendor Portal when the Replicated SDK is installed alongside the application. For more information, see [About Instance and Event Data](/vendor/instance-insights-event-data).

1. Under **Instance ID**, click on the ID to view additional insights including the versions of Kubernetes and the Replicated SDK running in the cluster where you installed the application. For more information, see [Instance Details](/vendor/instance-insights-details).
