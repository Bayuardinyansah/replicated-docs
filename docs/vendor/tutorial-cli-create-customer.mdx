# Step 5: Create a Customer

After creating a release, you must create a customer object.
A customer represents a single licensed end user of your application.

In this example, create a customer named `Some Big Bank` with an expiration in 10 days.

To create a customer license:

1. Run the following command to create the customer and assign them to a channel. For this example, since you created your release on the Unstable channel, assign the customer to the same channel:

  ```
  replicated customer create \
    --name "Some-Big-Bank" \
    --expires-in "240h" \
    --channel "Unstable"
  ```

  **Example output:**

  ```
  ID                             NAME             CHANNELS     EXPIRES                          TYPE
  2GuB3VYLjU5t9vNDK6byjgiTKUs    Some-Big-Bank     Unstable    2022-11-10 14:59:49 +0000 UTC    dev
  ```

1. Verify the customer creation details:

  ```
  replicated customer ls
  ```

1. Run the following command to download the license file for the customer that you just created:

  ```
  replicated customer download-license \
    --customer "Some-Big-Bank"
  ```

  **Example output**:

  ```
  apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
  kind: License
  metadata:
    name: some-big-bank
  spec:
    appSlug: cli-tutorial
    channelID: 2GmYFUFzj8JOSLYw0jAKKJKFua8
    channelName: Unstable
    customerName: Some-Big-Bank
    endpoint: https://replicated.app
    entitlements:
      expires_at:
        description: License Expiration
        title: Expiration
        value: "2022-11-10T14:59:49Z"
        valueType: String
    isNewKotsUiEnabled: true
    licenseID: 2GuB3ZLQsU38F5SX3n03x8qBzeL
    licenseSequence: 1
    licenseType: dev
    signature: eyJsaW...
  ```

1. Because the license downloads to `stdout`, run the following command to specify a name and location for the license file in your local directory:

  ```
  export LICENSE_FILE=~/Desktop/Some-Big-Bank-${REPLICATED_APP}-license.yaml
  replicated customer download-license --customer "Some-Big-Bank" > "${LICENSE_FILE}"
  ```

1. Verify the license was written properly using either `cat` or `head`:

  ```
  head ${LICENSE_FILE}
  ```
  **Example output*:
  ```
  apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
  kind: License
  metadata:
    name: some-big-bank
  spec:
    appSlug: cli-tutorial
    channelID: 2GmYFUFzj8JOSLYw0jAKKJKFua8
    channelName: Unstable
    customerName: Some-Big-Bank
    endpoint: https://replicated.app
  ```
