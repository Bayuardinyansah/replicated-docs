# Step 4: Add the Chart Archive to a Release

Next, create a new release with the NGINX Helm chart archive in the vendor portal.

A _release_ represents a single version of your application and contains your application files. Each release is promoted to one or more _channels_. Channels provide a way to progress releases through the software development lifecycle: from internal testing, to sharing with early-adopters, and finally to making the release generally available.

To create a release with the NGINX Helm chart archive:

1. In the vendor portal, click **Releases > Create release**. In the drop down, select **Create KOTS release**.

   A KOTS release can contain Helm charts and standard manifests. KOTS releases also include the extra manifests required by KOTS. KOTS releases that contain one or more Helm charts support installation with the Helm CLI and with KOTS.

1. In the editor, view the default manifest files generated by the vendor portal for KOTS releases.

   The files above the white line contain information for KOTS. The files below the white line are the sample NGINX application files.

1. On the release page, click **Promote**.

1. In the dialog, For **Which channels you would like to promote this release to?** select **Unstable**. Unstable is a default channel that is intended for use with internal testing.
