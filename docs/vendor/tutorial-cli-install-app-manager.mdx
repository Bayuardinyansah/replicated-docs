# Step 6: Install the App Manager

After you create and download a customer license, get the installation commands so that you can test the installation. These steps demonstrate the process of installing the app manager and the admin console in an existing cluster.

To install the app manager and admin console:

1. Run the following command to get the installation commands for the Unstable channel, where you promoted the release:

    ```
    replicated channel inspect Unstable
    ```

    **Example output:**

    ```
    ID:             2GmYFUFzj8JOSLYw0jAKKJKFua8
    NAME:           Unstable
    DESCRIPTION:
    RELEASE:        1
    VERSION:        Unstable-d4173a4
    EXISTING:

        curl -fsSL https://kots.io/install | bash
        kubectl kots install cli-tutorial/unstable

    EMBEDDED:

        curl -fsSL https://k8s.kurl.sh/cli-tutorial-unstable | sudo bash

    AIRGAP:

        curl -fSL -o cli-tutorial-unstable.tar.gz https://k8s.kurl.sh/bundle/cli-tutorial-unstable.tar.gz
        # ... scp or sneakernet cli-tutorial-unstable.tar.gz to airgapped machine, then
        tar xvf cli-tutorial-unstable.tar.gz
        sudo bash ./install.sh airgap
    ```

1. Access the cluster you provisioned as part of [Set Up the Environment](tutorial-cli-setup#set-up-the-environment). Run the installation script from above, using the `EXISTING` version:

  ```
  curl -fsSL https://kots.io/install | bash
  kubectl kots install cli-tutorial/unstable
  ```

1. For the **Enter the namespace to deploy to:** prompt in the installation script, enter `cli-tutorial`. This is the namespace where the admin console is installed.

1. For **Enter a new password to be used for the Admin Console:**, provide a password to access to the admin console.

   :::note
   You use this password in the next step to access the admin console and deploy the application.
   :::

   When the admin console is ready, the script prints the URL where you can access the admin console.

   **Example output**:

   ```
   Enter the namespace to deploy to: cli-tutorial
    • Deploying Admin Console
      • Creating namespace ✓
      • Waiting for datastore to be ready ✓
   Enter a new password to be used for the Admin Console: ••••••••
      • Waiting for Admin Console to be ready ✓

      • Press Ctrl+C to exit
      • Go to http://localhost:8800 to access the Admin Console
   ```

Continue to [Step 7: Deploy the Application](tutorial-cli-deploy-app) to access the admin console and deploy the application.
