# CI Workflows

This topic provides recommendations and considerations for integrating replicated CLI commands into your continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows.

## Overview

Using automated CI workflows to compile code and run tests against every commit to a shared repository improves the speed at which developers can test, iterate on, and deliver releases to customers. When you integrate replicated CLI commands into your CI pipeline, you can automate the process of creating customers, channels, clusters, and releases, rather than needing to manually create these artifacts to test your changes in a development environment.

Additionally, for users of GitHub Actions, Replicated offers example workflows in the [replicatedhq/replicated-actions](https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated-actions#examples) repository in GitHub.

## Recommended Workflows 

This section includes recommended CI workflow steps to integrate replicated CLI commands into a CI pipeline. How you implement these workflows varies depending on the CI platform that you use, such as GitHub, GitLab, CircleCI, TravisCI, or Jenkins.

### Workflow To Run on Every Commit

This workflow is intended to run on every commit to a branch. It creates a channel, customer, and cluster for running automated tests, then cleans up the artifacts after tests are complete.

1. Build application source code.
1. Create a channel and customer for that branch.
1. Deploy to a test cluster.

   Recommended to use the c11y matrix (recommended to create a kind cluster since itâ€™s lighter weight, and this is going to run on every commit):

   ```bash
   replicated cluster create --name kind-example --distribution kind --version 1.25.2 --disk 100 --instance-type r1.small
   ```

   See https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated-actions/tree/main/create-cluster

1. Run tests against that cluster.
1. Tear down the cluster.
1. Archive the channel and customer.

### Workflow for Creating Unstable Releases

For every commit that passes your code quality checks, Replicated recommends that you promote a release to your unstable (development) channel.

Replicated recommends that you run a workflow to creates a new release on the Unstable channel every time you merge a branch or commit to `main`.

1. Build application source code.
1. Create a channel and customer for the branch.
1. Create a matrix of clusters to create based on your common customer environments. You can go to the Customers page to see the common k8s distributions and versions

   **Example:**

   ```yaml
   # github actions example

   compatibility-matrix:
   runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
   strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        cluster: [ {distribution: k3s, version: "1.26"}, {distribution: k3s, version: "1.25"}, {distribution: eks, version: "1.27"}]
   ```

1. Create a release named for the commit: `Unstable-${SHA}`.
