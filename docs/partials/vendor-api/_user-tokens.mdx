User API tokens are private to the user creating the token. User tokens assume the user's account when used, including any RBAC permissions.

User token names must be unique per user.

User tokens are only displayed once, when created. The token cannot be retrieved again after the initial creation. 

Updates to a user's RBAC role are applied to all of the tokens belonging to that user.

Revoking a user token immediately invalidates that token. Additionally, deleting the user account also deletes all user tokens that belong to the user account.
