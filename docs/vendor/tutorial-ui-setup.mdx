# Introduction and Setup

<TutorialIntro/>

The steps in this UI-based tutorial show you how to use the Replicated vendor portal to create and promote releases for your application. The vendor portal is the user interface that you use as a software vendor to create, configure, and manage your application artifacts, including application releases, release channels, customer entitlements, private image registries, and more.

For a tutorial that demonstrates how to use the replicated CLI to create and promote releases for your application, see [CLI Tutorial](tutorial-cli-setup).

## Set Up the Environment

As part of this tutorial, you install a sample application onto an existing Kubernetes cluster, or onto a cluster provisioned by the Replicated Kubernetes installer. The Kubernetes installer creates the cluster on an existing VM.

Before you begin this tutorial, ensure that you have one of the following environments set up:

* A Kubernetes cluster that you can access with the kubectl command line tool. For more information about minimum requirements for installations, see [Installation Requirements](/enterprise/installing-general-requirements).

   For example, to create a cluster in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), run the following command in the gcloud CLI:
   ```
   gcloud container clusters create NAME --preemptible --no-enable-ip-alias
   ```
   Where `NAME` is any name for the cluster.

* A VM where the Kubernetes installer can create a cluster. For more information about minimum requirements for installations, see [Installation Requirements](/enterprise/installing-general-requirements).
