Replicated embedded cluster allows you to distribute a Kubernetes cluster as an appliance alongside your application, making it easy for enterprise users to install, update, and manage the application and the cluster in tandem. Embedded cluster is based on the open source Kubernetes distribution k0s. For more information, see the [k0s documentation](https://docs.k0sproject.io/stable/).

For software vendors, embedded cluster provides an simplified config for defining your Kubernetes distribution. Additionally, each version of embedded cluster includes a specific version of Replicated KOTS, ensuring compatiblity between KOTS and the cluster. For enterprise users, ongoing cluster management, such as joining, resetting, or removing nodes, can be completed from the KOTS admin console UI rather than through kubectl.
