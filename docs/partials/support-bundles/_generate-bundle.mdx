Support bundles can be generated from the CLI using the `kubectl support-bundle` command:

```bash
kubectl support-bundle --load-cluster-specs
```

The `--load-cluster-specs` flag automatically discovers all support bundle specifications that are defined in Secrets or ConfigMaps in the cluster. For a complete list of options with the `kubectl support-bundle` command, run `kubectl support-bundle --help`. For more information, see [Collecting a Support Bundle](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/support-bundle/collecting/) in the Troubleshoot documentation.
