# Step 4: Create a Customer

After promoting the release, create a customer so that you can install the release.

To create a customer:

1. In the [vendor portal](https://vendor.replicated.com), click **Customers > Create customer**.

   The **Create a new customer** page opens:

   ![Customer a new customer page in the vendor portal](/images/create-customer.png)
