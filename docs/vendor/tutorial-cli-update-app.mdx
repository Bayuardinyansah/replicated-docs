# Step 9: Update the Application

To test the new release that you promoted, return to the Replicated admin console in a browser to update the application.

To update the application:

1. In a browser, open the admin console at `https://localhost:8800`.

   :::note
   You can access the admin console as long as the installation script is running. If you press Ctrl+C to exit, run `kubectl kots admin-console --namespace cli-tutorial` to access the admin console again.
   :::

1. Go to the Version history page, and click **Check for update**.
