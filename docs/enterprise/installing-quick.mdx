# Quick Install

This topic provides basic installation steps for installing applications with Replicated KOTS in different types of environments. For complete KOTS installation requirements, see [Installation Requirements](installing-general-requirements).

## Existing Cluster

To install in an existing cluster:

1. Install the kots CLI and the KOTS admin console:

    ```shell
    curl https://kots.io/install | bash
    kubectl kots install APP_NAME
    ``` 
    Where `APP_NAME` is a name for the application. This is the unique name that KOTS will use to refer to the application that you install.

1. Follow the prompts in the CLI output to enter the target installation namespace and set a password for the admin console.

1. Go to the URL provided in the CLI output to log in to the admin console with the password you created.

1. Follow the instructions in the admin console to upload your license, configure the application, run preflight checks, and install.

For complete instructions and prerequisites, see [Online Installation in Existing Clusters](/enterprise/installing-existing-cluster).

## VM or Bare Metal Server (kURL)

You can use Replicated kURL to provision a cluster and install an application on a VM or bare metal server.

To install in an embedded kURL cluster on a VM or bare metal server:

1. Create the kURL cluster and install the KOTS admin console in the cluster:

   ```
   curl -sSL https://k8s.kurl.sh/APP_NAME | sudo bash
   ```
   Where `APP_NAME` is a name for the application. This is the unique name that KOTS will use to refer to the application that you install.
   :::note
   This command takes five to 10 minutes.
