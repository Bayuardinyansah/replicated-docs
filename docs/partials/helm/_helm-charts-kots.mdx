Helm is a popular package manager for Kubernetes applications. For vendors that support installations with KOTS, Replicated strongly recommends that you distribute your application as a Helm chart.

When you distribute your application as a Helm chart, you can support installations with both the Helm CLI and with KOTS from the same release, without having to maintain separate sets of Helm charts or application manifests. This is important because many enterprise users expect to be able to install an application with Helm.

Also, using KOTS to distribute Helm charts provides additional functionality not directly available with the Helm CLI, such as:
* The KOTS admin console
* Backup and restore with snapshots
* Support for air gap installations
* Support for embedded cluster installations on VMs or bare metal servers
