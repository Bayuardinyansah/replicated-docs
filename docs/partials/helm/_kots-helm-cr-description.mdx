To deploy Helm charts, KOTS requires a HelmChart custom resource for each Helm chart that you add to a release. You configure the HelmChart custom resource to provide the necessary instructions to KOTS for processing and preparing the chart for deployment. Additionally, the HelmChart custom resource creates a mapping between KOTS and your Helm chart to allow you to dynamically set values during installation or upgrade.
