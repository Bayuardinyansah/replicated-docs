Create an application using the Replicated CLI:

   1. On your local machine, install the Replicated CLI:

      ```bash
      brew install replicatedhq/replicated/cli
      ```
      For more installation options, see [Installing the Replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).

   1. Authorize the Replicated CLI:

      ```bash
      replicated login
      ```
      In the browser window that opens, complete the prompts to log in to your Vendor Portal account and authorize the CLI.

   1. Create an application named `Gitea`:

      ```bash
      replicated app create Gitea
      ```

   1. Set the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable to the application that you created. This allows you to interact with the application using the Replicated CLI without needing to use the `--app` flag with every command:

      1. Get the slug for the application that you created:

         ```bash
         replicated app ls
         ```
         **Example output**:
         ```bash
         ID                             NAME            SLUG           SCHEDULER
         2WthxUIfGT13RlrsUx9HR7So8bR    Gitea           gitea-kite     kots
         ```
         In the example above, the application slug is `gitea-kite`.

      1. Set the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable to the application slug.

         **Example:**

         ```bash
         export REPLICATED_APP=gitea-kite
         ```
