# Step 2: Add a Preflight Spec to the Chart

Create a preflight specification that fails if the cluster is running a version of Kubernetes earlier than 1.23.0. According to the Gitea installation requirements listed under [Prerequisites](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/gitea#prerequisites), Gitea requires Kubernetes 1.23.0 or later. 

Add the specification to the Gitea chart as a Kubernetes Secret. Including the spec in a Secret in the templates of a Helm chart allows preflight checks to be delivered as part of the application.

1. In the `gitea/templates` directory, create a `gitea-preflights.yaml` file:

   ```
   touch templates/gitea-preflights.yaml
   ```

1. In the `gitea-preflights.yaml` file, add the following YAML to create a Kubernetes Secret with a preflight check specification: 

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     labels:
       troubleshoot.sh/kind: preflight
     name: gitea-preflight-checks
   stringData:
     preflight.yaml: |
       apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
       kind: Preflight
       metadata:
         name: gitea-preflight-checks
       spec:
         analyzers:
           - clusterVersion:
               outcomes:
                 - fail:
                     when: "< 1.23.0"
                     message: |-
                       Your cluster is running a version of Kubernetes that is not supported and your installation will not succeed. To continue, upgrade your cluster to Kubernetes 1.23.0 or later.
                     uri: https://www.kubernetes.io
                 - pass:
                     message: Your cluster is running the recommended version of Kubernetes.
   ```

   This YAML defines a preflight check that fails if the target cluster is running a version of Kubernetes earlier than 1.23.0. The preflight check also includes a message to the user that describes the failure and lists the required Kubernetes version. 

1. Update dependencies and package the chart to a `.tgz` chart archive:

    ```bash
    helm package . --dependency-update
    ```       

## Next Step

Add the chart archive to a release.
