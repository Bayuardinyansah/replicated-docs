# Step 1: Install the replicated CLI

In this tutorial, you use the replicated CLI to create and promote releases for a sample application with Replicated. The replicated CLI is the CLI for the Replicated vendor portal. For a tutorial that uses the Replicated vendor portal UI to create and promote releases, see [UI Tutorial](tutorial-ui-setup).

:::note
Before you begin, ensure that you have completed the required environment setup. See [Set Up the Environment](tutorial-cli-setup#set-up-the-environment) in _Introduction and Setup_.

The first step in this tutorial is to install the replicated CLI on your local machine and set up a `REPLICATED_API_TOKEN` environment variable to authenticate.

To install the replicated CLI:

1. Run the following command to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install the CLI:

  ```
  brew install replicatedhq/replicated/cli
  ```

  Alternatively, use the latest Linux or macOS version from the [replicatedhq/replicated](https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated/releases) releases page in GitHub.

1. Verify the installation:

  ```
  replicated version
  ```
  **Example output**:

  ```json
  {
      "version": "0.37.2",
      "git": "8664ac3",
      "buildTime": "2021-08-24T17:05:26Z",
      "go": {
          "version": "go1.14.15",
          "compiler": "gc",
          "os": "darwin",
          "arch": "amd64"
      }
  }
  ```
  If you run a replicated CLI command, such as `replicated release ls`, you see the following error message about a missing API token:

  ```
  Error: set up APIs: Please provide your API token
  ```

1. To authenticate and begin using the replicated CLI, create an API token in your vendor portal account:

  1. Log in to the vendor portal, and go to the [Account settings](https://vendor.replicated.com/account-settings) page.

  1. Under User API Tokens, click **New User API Token**. For Nickname, provide a name for the token. For Permissions, select **Read and Write**.

     For more information about User API tokens, see [User Tokens](/reference/replicated-cli-tokens#user-tokens) in _Using Vendor API Tokens_.

  1. Click **Create Token**.

  1. Copy the string that appears in the dialog.

1. Export the user token string that you copied in the previous step to an environment variable named `REPLICATED_API_TOKEN`:

   ```
   export REPLICATED_API_TOKEN=1234567...
   ```

1. Run the following command to verify the User API token:

   ```
   replicated release ls
   ```

   This command no longer prints an error message about a missing API token. Rather, you see the following error message:

   ```
   Error: App not found:
   ```
