# Introduction and Setup

<TutorialIntro/>

The steps in this UI-based tutorial show you how to use the Replicated vendor portal to create and promote releases for a sample NGINX application. The vendor portal is the user interface that you use as a software vendor to create, configure, and manage your application artifacts, including application releases, release channels, customer entitlements, private image registries, and more.

For a tutorial that demonstrates how to use the replicated CLI to create and promote releases for your application, see [CLI Tutorial](tutorial-cli-setup).

## Set Up the Environment

As part of this tutorial, you install a sample application onto an existing Kubernetes cluster, or onto a cluster provisioned by the Replicated Kubernetes installer. The Kubernetes installer creates the cluster on an existing VM.

Do the following tasks before you begin this tutorial:

1. Ensure that you have one of the following environments set up:

    - A Kubernetes cluster that you can access with the kubectl command line tool. For more information about minimum requirements for installations, see [Installation Requirements](/enterprise/installing-general-requirements).

      For example, to create a cluster in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), run the following command in the gcloud CLI:
       ```
       gcloud container clusters create NAME --preemptible --no-enable-ip-alias
       ```
       Replace `NAME` with any name you want to use for the cluster.

    - A VM where the Kubernetes installer can create a cluster. For more information about minimum requirements for installations, see [Installation Requirements](/enterprise/installing-general-requirements).

      <VMRequirements/>

1. Install kubectl, the Kubernetes command line tool. See [Install Tools](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) in the Kubernetes documentation.
1. Configure kubectl command line access to the cluster that you created. See [Command line tool (kubectl)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) in the Kubernetes documentation.
