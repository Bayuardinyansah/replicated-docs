To perform an update from the Admin Console:

1. In the Admin Console, go to the **Version History** tab.
1. Do one of the following, depending on if you are in an online or air gap environment:
   * (Online) Click **Check for updates** to manually check for new versions of the application.
   * (Air gap) Click **Upload a new version** to upload a new version of the application.

   When the Admin Console downloads an update (for online), or when you upload an update (for air gap),
   a new upstream version displays in the list of available versions.

1. (Optional) When there are multiple versions of an application, you can compare
the changes between them by clicking **Diff releases** in the right corner.

   You can review changes between any two arbitrary releases by clicking the icon in the header
   of the release column. Select the two versions to compare, and click **Diff releases**
   to show the relative changes between the two releases.

the application vendor.

1. To update the application, return to the **Version History** tab
and click **Deploy** next to the target version.

   When you update an application, the current cluster is updated to the new version
   of the application and the Deployed status is set on that version.
