User API tokens are private to the user creating the token. User tokens assume the user's account when used, including any RBAC permissions.

Updates to a user's RBAC role are applied to all of the tokens belonging to that user.

Revoking a user token immediately invalidates that token. When a user account is deleted, its user tokens are also deleted.
