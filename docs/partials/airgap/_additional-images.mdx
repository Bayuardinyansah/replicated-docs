Any required images that are _not_ defined in your application manifests must be listed in the `additionalImages` attribute of the KOTS Application custom resource. This ensures that the images are included in the `.airgap` bundle for the release.

KOTS supports the following types of additional images:

* Public images referenced by the docker pullable image name
* Images pushed to a private, linked registry referenced by the docker pullable name
* Images pushed to the Replicated registry referenced by the `registry.replicated.com` name
