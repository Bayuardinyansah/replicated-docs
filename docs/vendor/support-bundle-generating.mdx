# Generating Support Bundles

This topic describes how to use the support-bundle kubectl CLI plugin to generate support bundles.

For KOTS installations, users can also generate support bundles from the Replicated admin console. For more information, see [Generating Support Bundles](https://docs.replicated.com/enterprise/troubleshooting-an-app) in the KOTS documentation.

## Prerequisite

<InstallPlugin/>

## Generate a Bundle from the CLI

<GenerateBundle/>

## Generate a Bundle when a Helm Installation Fails

If a Helm installation fails and you want to collect a support bundle to assist with diagnostics, you can use a Replicated default specification to generate the support bundle.

Run the following command:

```
kubectl support-bundle https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot-specs/main/in-cluster/default.yaml
```
