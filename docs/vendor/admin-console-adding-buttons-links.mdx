# Adding Links to the Dashboard

This topic describes how to use the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource to add links to the Replicated KOTS Admin Console dashboard.

## Overview

Replicated recommends that every application include a Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource. The Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource provides a standard API for creating, viewing, and managing applications. For more information, see [Kubernetes Applications](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application#kubernetes-applications) in the kubernetes-sigs GitHub repository.

You can include the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource in your releases to add links to the Admin Console dashboard. Common use cases include adding links to documentation, dashboards, or a landing page for the application.

For example, the following shows an **Open App** button on the dashboard of the Admin Console for an application named Gitea:

:::note
KOTS uses the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource as metadata and does not require or use an in-cluster controller to handle this custom resource. An application that follows best practices does not require cluster admin privileges or any cluster-wide components to be installed.

## Add a Link

To add a link to the Admin Console dashboard, include a [Kubernetes SIG Application](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application#kubernetes-applications) custom resource in the release with a `spec.descriptor.links` field. The `spec.descriptor.links` field is an array of links that are displayed on the Admin Console dashboard after the application is deployed.

Each link in the `spec.descriptor.links` array contains two fields:
* `description`: The link text that will appear on the Admin Console dashboard.
* `url`: The target URL.

For example:

```yaml
# app.k8s.io/v1beta1 Application Custom resource

apiVersion: app.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: "gitea"
spec:
  descriptor:
    links:
      - description: About Wordpress
        url: "https://wordpress.org/"
```

When the application is deployed, the "About Wordpress" link is displayed on the Admin Console dashboard as shown below:

<img alt="About Wordpress link on the Admin Console dashboard" src="/images/dashboard-link-about-wordpress.png" width="450px"/>

For an additional example of a Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource, see [application.yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application/blob/master/docs/examples/wordpress/application.yaml) in the kubernetes-sigs GitHub repository.

### KOTS Template Functions in URLs

You can use KOTS template functions to template URLs in the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource. This can be useful when all or some of the URL is a user-supplied value.

For example, an application might allow users to provide their own Ingress object. In this case, the URL can be templated to render the hostname for the Ingress object that the user supplies on the Admin Console config screen.

The following example shows how to use the KOTS [ConfigOption](/reference/template-functions-config-context#configoption) template function in the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource `spec.descriptor.links.url` field to render a user-supplied hostname in the URL:

```yaml
apiVersion: app.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: "my-app"
spec:
  descriptor:
    links:
      - description: Open App
        url: 'http://{{repl ConfigOption "ingress_host" }}'
```

For more information about working with KOTS template functions, see [About Template Functions](/reference/template-functions-about).

## About Adding Links to Application Services Using KOTS `ports`

You can configure the KOTS Application custom resource [`ports`](/reference/custom-resource-application#ports) key to expose and add links to services on the Admin Console dashboard: 
* For existing cluster installations, the `ports` key adds the given service to the KOTS port forward tunnel so it can be easily accessed by the user after installation. 
* For Replicated Embedded Cluster or Replicated kURL installations, unlike installations in existing clusters, the `ports` key cannot be used to port forward a service. This is because KOTS does not open the port forward tunnel in installations on VMs or bare metal servers as it cannot be verified that the ports are secure and authenticated. However, you can still add a NodePort service to the `ports` key for the purpose of adding a link to the service on the Admin Console dashboard.

This can make it easier for the person or process installing your application to easily verify that the application is running, since it can be difficult to provide a consistent application URL at installation. For example, the cluster operator might be required to configure ingress or create firewall rules before they can open the application. 

Adding a link to a service using the KOTS `ports` key requires that you add the _same_ URL in the `ports.applicationURL` and Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource `spec.descriptor.links.url` fields. When these fields match, KOTS automatically rewrites this URL during deployment with the hostname in the browser (the hostname where the Admin Console is accessed) and appends the specified port.
