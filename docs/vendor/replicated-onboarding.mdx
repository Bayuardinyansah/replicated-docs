# Helm CLI-Only Onboarding

This topic describes how to onboard applications that will support Helm CLI installations only.

If your application will also support KOTS and Embedded Cluster installations in addition to Helm CLI installations, see [KOTS and Embedded Cluster Onboarding](distributing-workflow). 

## Before You Begin

This section includes guidance and prerequisites to review before you begin onboarding your application.

### Best Practices and Recommendations

### Prerequisites

<Prerequisites/>

## Onboarding

### Step 0: Package Your Helm Chart with the Replicated SDK

<PackageSdk/>

### Step 1: Connect Your Image Registry and Enable the Proxy Service

<a href="/vendor/helm-image-registry">Proxying Images for Helm Installations</a>

### Step 2: Add Preflight Checks and Support Bundles

<PreflightSupportBundle/>

### Step 3: Customize Customer Licenses

Add custom license entitlements, and use the SDK API to check entitlements in the customer environment.

* Add custom entitlements
* Add entitlement checks
* License field signature validation

<a href="/vendor/licenses-reference-helm">Checking Entitlements in Helm Charts Before Deployment</a>

<p>Use the SDK API to add checks for customer license entitlements during runtime.</p>
<p>To get started, use the SDK in integration mode to develop locally without needing to make real changes in the Vendor Portal or in your environment.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated time:</strong> 1 hour to integrate pre-installation license checks into your application, plus more time to test and iterate</p>

<li><a href="/reference/replicated-sdk-apis">Replicated SDK API</a></li>
<li><a href="/vendor/replicated-sdk-development">Developing Against the SDK API</a></li>
</ul>  

<p>Verify the signatures of license fields when you check customer entitlements in your application.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated time:</strong> 2 hours, including time to add entitlement checks in your application if you have not already</p>

### Step 4: Add Custom Domains

<p>Configure custom domains to alias the Replicated endpoints that are used for customer-facing URLs, such as <code>registry.replicated.com</code> and <code>proxy.replicated.com</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated time:</strong> 30 minutes, plus up to 24 hours to create and verify the CNAME record in your DNS account.</p>

## Next Steps

### Customize Release Channels

### Configure Advanced Features

* Custom metrics:

  <p>Use the SDK API to send custom metrics that measure instances of your application running in online or air gap environments.</p>
  <p>To get started, use the SDK in integration mode to develop locally without needing to make real changes in the Vendor Portal or in your environment.</p>
  <p><strong>Estimated time:</strong> 30 minutes to create mock data and test the endpoints locally with integration mode, plus more time to integrate with your application</p>
  <a href="/vendor/custom-metrics">Configuring Custom Metrics</a>

* SDK API (update checks)

  <p>Use the SDK API to allow your users to easily check for available updates from your application..</p>
  <p>To get started, use the SDK in integration mode to develop locally without needing to make real changes in the Vendor Portal or in your environment.</p>
  <p><strong>Estimated time:</strong> 1 hour to mock endpoints locally with integration mode, plus more time to optionally integrate with your application</p>

### Integrate with CI/CD and Compatibility Matrix

<p>Update your existing development and release CI/CD pipelines to automatically complete tasks such as creating and promoting releases, provisioning clusters to test installation with the Replicated Compatibility Matrix, installing releases in test environments, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated time:</strong> 1 to 2 hours to configure your CI pipeline using Replicated CLI commands or Replicated GitHub Actions.</p>
