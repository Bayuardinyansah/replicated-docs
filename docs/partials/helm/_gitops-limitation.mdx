The GitOps workflow is not supported for installations with the HelmChart custom resource `apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta2` or the HelmChart custom resource `apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1` with `useHelmInstall: true`. Use of GitOps with KOTS is no longer recommended. For modern enterprise customers that prefer CI/CD pipeline style software deployment processes, Replicated recommends using the available [Helm CLI deployment method](/vendor/distributing-overview#helm-cli-installations), which is more commonly used in these types of enterprise environments.
