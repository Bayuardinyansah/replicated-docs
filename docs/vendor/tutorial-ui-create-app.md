To begin, create an application object in the vendor portal:

1. Log in (or create a new team) to the [vendor portal](https://vendor.replicated.com).

  After signing up and activating your account, the Create application page opens.

1. Enter a name for the new application, such as Starter Application or NGINX Example.

1. Click **Create Application**.

  The application is created, and the Channels page opens and displays a list of your release channels that are logical stacks for you to stage and promote releases to your customers. We will explore this in more detail later.
