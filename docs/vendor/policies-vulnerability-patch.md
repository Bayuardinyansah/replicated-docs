# Vulnerability Patch Policy

While it’s our goal to distribute vulnerability-free versions of all components, this isn’t always possible.
Kubernetes and KOTS are made from many components, each authored by different vendors.

The best way to stay ahead of vulnerabilities is to run the latest version and have a strategy to quickly update when a patch is available.

## How We Scan

Our build pipeline uses [Trivy](https://www.aquasec.com/products/trivy/) to scan for and detect known, published vulnerabilities in our images.
It’s possible that other security scanners will detect a different set of results.
We commit to patching vulnerabilities according to the timeline below based on the results of our internal scans.

If you or your customer detects a different vulnerability using a different scanner, we encourage you to report it to us in a GitHub issue, Slack message, or emailing support@replicated.com.
Our team will evaluate the vulnerability and determine the best course of action.

## Base Images

When possible, KOTS uses alpine, scratch, or distroless images to reduce the number of components that might be affected by CVEs.
When a larger base image is required, we will keep it updated to the latest version available based on the following timeline:

| Base Version Change | Time to include in release |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Patch version | Within 2 weeks |
| Minor version | Within 30 days |
| Major version | Before the previous version is EOL |


## Upstream CVE Disclosure

Replicated KOTS and kURL deliver many upstream Kubernetes and ecosystem components.
We do not build these packages and rely on the upstream software vendor to distribute patches.
Our intent is to make any patches available as soon as possible, but guarantee the following timeline to make upstream patches available after we learn about the vulnerability and a patch is available to us:

| CVE Level | Time to release |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Critical | Within 2 weeks |
| High | Within 60 days |
| Medium | Within 90 days |
| Low | Best effort unless risk accepted |

## Notable Upstream CVEs

The following CVEs have yet to be resolved by the upstream maintainers and therefore are not patched in Replicated. This is not an exhaustive list of unpatched upstream CVEs; instead, these are noteworthy CVEs that we have evaluated and on which we offer our opinion to help with your own security reviews. When available, we will apply upstream patches in accordance with our policy desribed in [Upstream CVE Disclosure](#upstream-cve-disclosure) above. We will update this list after applying any upstream patches.

| CVE ID | Explanation|
|--------|------------|
|CVE-2022-1292| The reported vulnerability affects an OpenSSL script in the container image, ```(c_rehash)```, but neither Velero nor Replicated use this script. As such, it is our opinion that CVE-2022-1292 is not remotely exploitable within Replicated.|

## Vulnerability Management Exceptions
There might be instances where policy exceptions are required to continue using third party software with known vulnerabilities in our on premises products. Some reasons for an exception include:

- Feature breakage or bugs in patched versions
- Performance issues in patched versions
- Patched version contains higher severity vulnerabilities

Regardless of the reason, an exception is vetted from a business impact and security standpoint. The business review assesses the overall impact to the product created by the patched, but otherwise problematic, piece of software. The security portion determines if the CVE is applicable to this specific context and if that CVE's impact to the product’s overall security posture is acceptable.

In the event of a vulnerability management exception, a notice is posted containing:

- The impacted product(s)
- The rationale for the exception
- The relevant CVE(s)
- A risk assessment in the product context for each CVE

As subsequent versions of the vulnerable software are released, Replicated continues to research to find a solution that satisfies the business and security requirements of the original exception. 

## Known Disclosed Vulnerabilities in our On Premises Products

KOTS uses an older version of Kustomize, v3.5.4, released in January 2020. We continue to include and use this version because newer versions, including v3.10.0 through v4.x, are 6 to 12 times slower. This imparts an unacceptable delay when saving application configuration or applying updates in KOTS. However, v3.5.4 also contains a number of high or critical vulnerabilities. We have assessed each of these vulnerabilities for both relevance to KOTS as well as risk.

Based on this analysis, we feel these vulnerabilities do not meaningfully detract from KOTS overall security posture while still maintaining usability. We continue to performance test new versions of Kustomize to find a suitably performant and secure version. At this time, we are continuing to include v3.5.4 with the known vulnerabilities until a better solution is available.

The following table lists the vulnerabilities in Kustomize v3.5.4, including a summary, rationale, and link for more information.

| CVE | CVE Summary | Rationale | Additional Reading |
|-----|-------------|-----------|--------------------|
|CVE-2014-3499|Docker 1.0.0 uses world-readable and world-writable permissions on the management socket, which allows local users to gain privileges via unspecified vectors. |	If Docker is the CRI of choice, Docker 1.0.0 is unlikely to be in use. Alternatively, another CRI may be implemented as a compensating control.	| [CVE-2014-3499 Details](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-3499)
CVE-2014-6407 |	Docker earlier than 1.3.2 allows remote attackers to write to arbitrary files and execute arbitrary code via a (1) symlink or (2) hard link attack in an image archive in a (a) pull or (b) load operation. |	Exploitation requires a malicious image.

CVE-2020-14040 | A denial of service vulnerability was found in the golang.org/x/text library. If an attacker supplies specific input there is the potential to cause an infinite loop to occur using more memory, resulting in a denial of service. |	KOTS does not accept generic user input, only Kubernetes manifests which are then passed to Kustomize. Additionally, there is never a direct interface to golang’s text library |	[CVE-2020-14040](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-14040) |
|CVE-2020-27847| A vulnerability exists in the SAML connector of the github.com/dexidp/dex library used to process SAML Signature Validation. This flaw allows an attacker to bypass SAML authentication. The highest threats from this vulnerability are to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. This flaw affects dex versions before 2.27.0. | This is a false positive from Trivy. This vulnerability applies to Dex version 2.27.0 and earlier, whereas Replicated is using Dex version 2.32.0. Dex does not follow Go's semantic versioning convention, which may explain the erroneous result from Trivy. | https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots/pull/2934 https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/issues/2433 https://github.com/dexidp/dex/issues/1578#issuecomment |
|CVE-2021-38561 | Due to improper index calculation, an incorrectly formatted language tag can cause Parse to panic, due to an out of bounds read. If Parse is used to process untrusted user inputs, this may be used as a vector for a denial of service attack. | KOTS does not accept generic user input, only Kubernetes manifests which are then passed to Kustomize. Additionally, there is never a direct interface to golang’s text library | https://www.mend.io/vulnerability-database/CVE-2021-38561 |
|CVE-2021-3121 | A flaw in protobuf before 1.3.2 allows a remote attacker to send specific protobuf messages to cause a denial of service | Protobuf is included in the Kustomize binary but Kustomize never acts as a protobuf server so it is not possible for an attacker to send the specific protobuf messages required to exploit this vulnerability | https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2021-3121 |
