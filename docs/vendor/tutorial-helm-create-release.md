# Step 4: Add the Chart Archive to a Release

Next, create a new release with the NGINX Helm chart archive in the vendor portal.

A _release_ represents a single version of your application and contains your application files. Each release is promoted to one or more _channels_. Channels provide a way to progress releases through the software development lifecycle: from internal testing, to sharing with early-adopters, and finally to making the release generally available.

To create a release with the NGINX Helm chart archive:

1. In the vendor portal, click **Releases > Create release**. In the drop down, select **Create KOTS release**.

   A KOTS release can contain Helm charts and standard manifests. KOTS releases also include the extra manifests required by KOTS. KOTS releases that contain one or more Helm charts support installation with the Helm CLI and with KOTS.

1. In the release YAML editor, view the default manifest files generated by the vendor portal for the KOTS release.

   The files above the white line contain information for KOTS. The files below the white line are the sample NGINX application files.

1. In the **Select Installation Method** dialog, click **OK** to select version kots.io/v1beta2 of the HelmChart custom resource. KOTS uses the HelmChart custom resource to install the Helm chart.

1. View the contents of the default HelmChart custom resource that is added to the release:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta2
   kind: HelmChart
   metadata:
     name: replicated-onboarding
   spec:
     # chart identifies a matching chart from a .tgz
     chart:
       name: replicated-onboarding
       chartVersion: 0.1.0
  
     # values are used in the customer environment, as a pre-render step
     # these values will be supplied to helm template
     values: {}

     # builder values provide a way to render the chart with all images
     # and manifests. this is used in replicated to create airgap packages
     builder: {}
   ```

1. Click **Create release**.

1. Click **Promote**. In the dialog, for **Which channels you would like to promote this release to?**, select **Unstable**. Unstable is a default channel that is intended for use with internal testing. Click **Promote**.

## Next Step

Create a customer so that you can install the release in your cluster. See [Create a Customer](tutorial-helm-create-customer).
