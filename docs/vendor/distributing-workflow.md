# Distributing Your Application

After you finish iterating and testing a release in the Unstable channel, you can distribute the release to customers.

To distribute your production application:

1. Promote the release to the desired channel in the vendor portal. You can use the default channels or edit them, or create a custom channel. See [Creating and Editing Channels](releases-creating-channels).

1. (Recommended) To support installations with the kots CLI, provide your users with a template of the ConfigValues file for the release. See [Downloading the ConfigValues File](/vendor/releases-configvalues).

1. Share with each customer the license file that you created and the installation command available in the vendor portal. See [Sharing the License Files and Application Releases](releases-sharing-license-install-script).
