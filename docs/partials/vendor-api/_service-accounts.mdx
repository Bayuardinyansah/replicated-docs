Service accounts are assigned a token and associated with an RBAC policy. Any user with the proper permissions can create, retrieve or revoke them. Admin users can assign any RBAC policy to a service account. Non-admin users can only assign their own RBAC policy.

At creation time, users can also choose to limit the service account to a read-only version of the selected RBAC policy

Service account names must be unique within a given team.

Service account tokens are only displayed once when created. The token cannot be retrieved again after initial creation. 

Updates to a service account's RBAC policy are automatically applied to its associated token. When a service account is removed, its token is also invalidated.
