## Generate a Bundle when a Helm Installation Fails

If a Helm installation fails and you want to collect a support bundle to assist with diagnostics, you can use a Replicated default specification to generate the support bundle.

Run the following command:

```bash
kubectl support-bundle https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot-specs/main/in-cluster/default.yaml
```
