1. SSH onto a controller node in the cluster and download the new air gap bundle using the curl command copied during the install steps. For more information, see [Install](#install) above.

     Because this command downloads the latest release on the channel, it will download the bundle for your newly promoted release.

1. Untar the tarball and ensure that the `APP_SLUG.airgap` air gap bundle is present.

1. Use the `update` command to upload the air gap bundle and make this new version available in the Admin Console. For example:

    ```bash
    ./APP_SLUG update --airgap-bundle APP_SLUG.airgap
    ```

1. When the air gap bundle has been uploaded, visit the Admin Console and click **Deploy** to deploy this new version.
