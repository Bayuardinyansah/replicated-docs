For installations in existing clusters and in Replicated kURL clusters, the Replicated KOTS Admin Console uses the open source systems monitoring tool Prometheus to collect metrics on an application and the cluster where the application is installed. Prometheus components include the main Prometheus server, which scrapes and stores time series data, and an Alertmanager for alerting on metrics. For more information about Prometheus, see [What is Prometheus?](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) in the Prometheus documentation.

The Admin Console exposes graphs with key metrics collected by Prometheus in the **Monitoring** section of the dashboard. By default, the Admin Console includes the following graphs:

* Cluster disk usage
* Pod CPU usage
* Pod memory usage

In addition to these default graphs, application developers can also expose business and application level metrics and alerts on the dashboard.

The following screenshot shows an example of the **Monitoring** section on the Admin Console dashboard with the Disk Usage, CPU Usage, and Memory Usage default graphs.

For kURL installations, the Prometheus monitoring system is included by default alongside the installed application. No additional configuration is required to collect metrics and view any default and custom graphs on the Admin Console dashboard.

For existing cluster installations with KOTS, users can install Prometheus and connect the Admin Console to the Prometheus endpoint to enable monitoring. For information about how to set up Prometheus monitoring in existing clusters, see [Configure Monitoring in Existing Clusters](/enterprise/monitoring-applications#configure-existing).
