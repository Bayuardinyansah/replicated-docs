# Step X: Create an Application

Create an application in the Replicated vendor portal. An _application_ is an object that has its own customers, channels, releases, license fields, and more.

A single team can have more than one application in the vendor portal. It is common for teams to have multiple applications for the purpose of testing and iterating.

To create an application:

1. Log in to the [vendor portal](https://vendor.replicated.com/).

1. In the top left of the page, open the application drop down and click **Create new app...**.
