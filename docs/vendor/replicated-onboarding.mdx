# Helm CLI-Only Onboarding

This topic describes how to onboard applications that will support Helm CLI installations only.

If your application will also support KOTS and Embedded Cluster installations in addition to Helm CLI installations, see [KOTS and Embedded Cluster Onboarding](distributing-workflow). 

## Before You Begin

This section includes guidance and prerequisites to review before you begin onboarding your application.

## Onboarding

### Step 0: Package Your Helm Chart with the Replicated SDK

<PackageSdk/>

### Step 0: Connect Your Image Registry

### Step 0: Enable the Proxy Service

### Step 0: Add Preflight Checks and Support Bundles

<Preflights/>

<SupportBundles/>

### Step 0: Customize Customer Licenses

Add custom license entitlements, and use the SDK API to check entitlements in the customer environment.

* Add custom entitlements
* Add entitlement checks
* License field signature validation

<a href="/vendor/licenses-reference-helm">Checking Entitlements in Helm Charts Before Deployment</a>

<p>Use the SDK API to add checks for customer license entitlements during runtime.</p>
<p>To get started, use the SDK in integration mode to develop locally without needing to make real changes in the Vendor Portal or in your environment.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated time:</strong> 1 hour to integrate pre-installation license checks into your application, plus more time to test and iterate</p>

<li><a href="/reference/replicated-sdk-apis">Replicated SDK API</a></li>
<li><a href="/vendor/replicated-sdk-development">Developing Against the SDK API</a></li>
</ul>  

<p>Verify the signatures of license fields when you check customer entitlements in your application.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated time:</strong> 2 hours, including time to add entitlement checks in your application if you have not already</p>
