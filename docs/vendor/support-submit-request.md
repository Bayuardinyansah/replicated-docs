# Submitting a Support Request

This topic describes how to submit a support request with or without a support bundle.

## Submit a Support Request

You can submit a support request using the Replicated vendor portal. Uploading a support bundle is secure and helps the Replicated support team troubleshoot your application faster.

If you or your customer are unable to generate a support bundle, you can submit the request without a support bundle and the support team will assist you.

For more information about how to generate a support bundle using either the Replicated admin console or the kubectl CLI, see [Troubleshooting an application](https://docs.replicated.com/enterprise/troubleshooting-an-app).

To submit a support request:

1. From the [vendor portal](https://vendor.replicated.com), click **Support** in the upper right corner of the page.

  The Vendor Support page opens.

1. Click **Submit a Support Request**.

  The Support Request dialog opens.

1. In section 1, enter your name, and edit the remaining fields. Describe the issue, and select the type of installation that it is impacting, the application name, and the environment. You can also select **I'd like to schedule a video call to resolve**.
