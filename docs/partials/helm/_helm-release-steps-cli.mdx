To create and promote a release with your Helm chart using the CLI:

1. Install the replicated CLI. See [Installing the replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).

1. Set the environment variables:
     * Set the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable to the slug for your application in the vendor portal. 
     * Set the `REPLICATED_API_TOKEN` environment variable to your user API token from the vendor portal.
     
    See [Set Environment Variables](/reference/replicated-cli-installing#set-environment-variables) in _Installing the replicated CLI_.

    **Example**:

    ```bash
    export REPLICATED_APP=my-app-slug
    export REPLICATED_API_TOKEN=1234abcd
    ```
1. Create a release and promote it to the Unstable channel:

   ```bash
   replicated release create --chart=CHART_TGZ_FILE --promote=Unstable
   ```
   Replace `CHART_TGZ_FILE` with the `.tgz` Helm chart package that you created. For example, `--chart=my-chart-1.0.0.tgz`.

1. Confirm the release was created:

   ```
   replicated release ls
   ```
