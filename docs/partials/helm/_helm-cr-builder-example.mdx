The following example demonstrates how to add a conditional `postgresql` resource to the `builder` key.

`postgresql` is defined as a conditional resource in the `values` key of the HelmChart custom resource:

```yaml
  values:
    postgresql:
      enabled: repl{{ ConfigOptionEquals `postgres_type` `embedded_postgres`}}
```
As shown above, `postgresql` is included only when the user selects the `embedded_postgres` option.

To ensure this conditional `postgresql` resource is included in the installation files, add the same `postgresql` value to the `builder` key with `enabled` set to `true`:

```yaml
  builder:
    postgresql:
      enabled: true
```
