# Adding Links to the Dashboard

This topic describes how to use the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource to add links to the Replicated KOTS Admin Console dashboard.

## Overview

Replicated recommends that every application include a Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource. The Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource provides a standard API for creating, viewing, and managing applications. For more information, see [Kubernetes Applications](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application#kubernetes-applications) in the kubernetes-sigs GitHub repository.

You can include the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource in your releases to add links to the Admin Console dashboard. Common use cases include adding links to documentation, dashboards, or a landing page for the application.

For example, the following shows an **Open App** button on the dashboard of the Admin Console for an application named Gitea:

:::note
KOTS uses the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource as metadata and does not require or use an in-cluster controller to handle this custom resource. An application that follows best practices does not require cluster admin privileges or any cluster-wide components to be installed.

## Add a Link

To add a link to the Admin Console dashboard, include a [Kubernetes SIG Application](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application#kubernetes-applications) custom resource in the release.

The SIG Application resource must include a `spec.descriptor.links` field, which is an array of links that will be displayed on the dashboard after the application is deployed. Each link in the `spec.descriptor.links` array contains two fields:
* `description`: The link text that will appear on the Admin Console dashboard.
* `url`: The target URL.

For example:

```yaml
# app.k8s.io/v1beta1 Application Custom resource

apiVersion: app.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: "gitea"
spec:
  descriptor:
    links:
      - description: About Wordpress
        url: "https://wordpress.org/"
```

When the application is deployed, the "About Wordpress" link is displayed on the Admin Console dashboard as shown below:

<img alt="About Wordpress link on the Admin Console dashboard" src="/images/dashboard-link-about-wordpress.png" width="450px"/>

For an example of a Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource, see [application.yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application/blob/master/docs/examples/wordpress/application.yaml) in the kubernetes-sigs GitHub repository.

### KOTS Template Functions in URLs

You can use KOTS template functions to template URLs in the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource. This can be useful when all or some of the URL is a user-supplied value.

For example, an application might allow users to provide their own Ingress object. In this case, the URL can be templated to render the hostname for the Ingress object that the user supplies on the Admin Console config screen.

The following example shows how to use the KOTS [ConfigOption](/reference/template-functions-config-context#configoption) template function in the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource `spec.descriptor.links.url` field to render a user-supplied hostname in the URL:

```yaml
apiVersion: app.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: "my-app"
spec:
  descriptor:
    links:
      - description: Open App
        url: 'http://{{repl ConfigOption "ingress_host" }}'
```

For more information about working with KOTS template functions, see [About Template Functions](/reference/template-functions-about).

## Link to Services Using KOTS

When distributing an application, it is helpful to ensure that the person or process installing the application is able to easily verify that the application is running. However, differences in customer environments make it difficult to provide a consistent application URL at installation.

To make it easier for users to access the deployed application, KOTS includes logic that can automatically rewrite the URL provided in the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource.

To rewrite this URL during application deployment, KOTS first checks if the `ports.applicationURL` field matches the `descriptor.links.url` field in the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource. If the URLs match, then KOTS rewrites the URL to `http://localhost:{localPort}`, adding the local port provided for the service in the KOTS Application custom resource. Then, KOTS rewrites `localhost` to the hostname where the Admin Console is being accessed. For example, if the Admin Console is accessed at `gitea-admin.example.com:8800`, then the URL is rewritten to `http://gitea-admin.example.com:{localPort}`.
