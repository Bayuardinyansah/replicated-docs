# Air Gap Installation in Existing Clusters

## About Private Registries

Air gapped networks must have a Docker image registry that is available inside the network. KOTS rewrites the application image names in all application manifests to read from the on-premises registry, and it re-tags and pushes the images to the on-premises registry. When authenticating to the registry, credentials with `push` permissions are required.

A single application expects to use a single namespace in the Docker image registry. The namespace name can be any valid URL-safe string, supplied at installation time. A registry typically expects the namespace to exist before any images can be pushed into it.

:::note
ECR does not use namespaces.

## Prerequisites

Complete the following prerequisites:

<PrereqsExistingCluster/>

* Ensure that there is a compatible Docker image registry available inside the network. For more information about Docker registry compatibility, see [Private Registry Requirements](/enterprise/installing-general-requirements#private-registry-requirements).

## Install KOTS {#air-gap}

This procedure describes how to install KOTS in your existing cluster using the `kotsadm.tar.gz` air gap bundle.

<KotsAbout/>

To install KOTS:

1. <InstallKotsCliAirGap/>

    <KotsVersionMatch/>

1. <PushKotsImages/>

1. Install the KOTS admin console using the images that you pushed in the previous step:

   ```shell
   kubectl kots install APP_NAME \
     --kotsadm-registry REGISTRY_HOST \
     --registry-username RO-USERNAME \
     --registry-password RO-PASSWORD
   ```

   Replace:

    * `APP_NAME` with a name for the application. This is the unique name that KOTS will use to refer to the application that you install.
