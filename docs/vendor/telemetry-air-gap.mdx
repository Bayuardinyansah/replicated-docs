# Collecting Telemetry for Air Gap Instances (Beta)

This topic describes how to collect telemetry for instances in air gap environments. The information in this topic applies to instances installed with Replicated KOTS.

:::note
Air gap telemetry is in beta. The functionality, requirements, and limitations of air gap telemetry are subject to change.
:::

## Overview

Air gap instances run in environments without outbound internet access. This limitation prevents these instances from sending telemetry data to the Replicated vendor portal through the Replicated SDK or Replicated KOTS. For information about how the SDK and KOTS send telemetry from online (internet-connected) instances, see [About Instance and Event Data](/vendor/instance-insights-event-data#about-reporting).

<AirGapTelemetry/>

All support bundles that are uploaded to the vendor portal from any air gap customer contribute to a comprehensive dataset, providing parity in the telemetry for air gap and online instances. Replicated recommends that you collect support bundles from air gap customers regularly (monthly or quarterly) to improve the completeness of air gap telemetry. The vendor portal handles any overlapping event archives idempotently, ensuring data integrity.

## Requirements

Air gap telemetry has the following requirements:

* KOTS v1.101.0 or later must be installed in the environment where the instance is running
* The Replicated SDK must be installed in the environment where the instance is running. For more information, see [Installing the Replicated SDK](/vendor/replicated-sdk-installing).
* The support bundle must be generated by KOTS. Generic troubleshoot specs (which do not include instance data) do not contribute to telemetry for air gap instances.
* KOTS must be running in air gapped mode to collect telemetry from a support bundle. Air gapped mode is enabled with the `--airgap=true` flag, the `--airgap-bundle` flag, or when images are pushed to a local registry. For more information, see [Air Gap Installation in Existing Clusters](/enterprise/installing-existing-cluster-airgapped#air-gap) or [Installing with the CLI](/enterprise/installing-existing-cluster-automation).  

## Limitations

Air gap telemetry has the following limitations:

* Air gap telemetry is supported only for instances installed with KOTS. Air gap telemetry is not supported for instances installed with the Helm CLI.
* Telemetry data is capped at 4,000 events or 1MB; whichever limit is reached first. For optimal use, consider collecting support bundles regularly (monthly or quarterly) from air gap customers.

## Collect and View Air Gap Telemetry

To collect telemetry from air gap instances:

1. Instruct your customer to generate a support bundle. Support bundles can be generated using the `kubectl support-bundle` CLI or from the KOTS admin console **Troubleshoot** tab. For more information, see [Generating a Support Bundle with the CLI](/enterprise/troubleshooting-an-app#generating-a-support-bundle-using-the-cli) or [Generating a Support Bundle Using the Admin Console](/enterprise/troubleshooting-an-app#generate-a-support-bundle-using-the-admin-console).

1. Upload your support bundle via the Customers page, Customer Reporting page, or the Instance Details page.

     The telemetry appears on the page shortly. Allow a few minutes for all data to be processed.
