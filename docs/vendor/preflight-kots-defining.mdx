# Define Preflight Checks for KOTS

 This topic provides a basic understanding and some key considerations about preflight checks for KOTS installations to help guide you in defining them for your application.

## About KOTS Preflight Checks

<PreflightsAbout/> 

Preflight are included in your application package and run automatically before installing the application.

<PreflightsSpecLocations/>

## Input Kind

When you run preflight checks with KOTS, you must use the Preflight custom resource (`kind: Preflight`).

You can wrap the Preflight custom resource in the following inputs:

- Secret (kind: Secret)
- ConfigMap (kind: ConfigMap)

Secrets and Config maps are installed in the cluster. Replicated recommends using Secrets to protect secure information in the cluster.

## Create a Secret

<SecretsConfig/>

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  labels:
    troubleshoot.sh/kind: preflight
  name: "{{ .Release.Name }}-preflight-config"
stringData:
  preflight.yaml: |
    apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
    kind: Preflight
    metadata:
      name: preflight-sample
    spec:
      collectors:[]
      analyzers:[]
```

## Create a Preflight Custom Resource

You can define preflight checks for KOTS without using a Secret. The following example shows a basic Preflight custom resource manifest file (`kind: Preflight`) in your release.

<PreflightsCrNote/>

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
kind: Preflight
metadata:
  name: preflights
spec:
  collectors: []
  analyzers: []
```

Next, define the preflight checks specification by adding collectors and analyzers. Optionally, you can add to the default redactors. For more information, see [Define the Preflight Checks Specification](#kots-preflights).

## Define the Preflight Checks Specification {#kots-preflights}

<PreflightsDefine/>

### Collectors

Add collectors to define information to be collected for analysis during the analyze phase. For example, you can collect information about the MySQL version that is running in a cluster:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
   kind: Preflight
   metadata:
      name: supported-mysql-version
   spec:
      collectors:
        - mysql:
            collectorName: mysql
            uri: 'repl{{ ConfigOption "db_user" }}:repl{{ConfigOption "db_password" }}@tcp(repl{{ ConfigOption "db_host" }}:repl{{ConfigOption "db_port" }})/repl{{ ConfigOption "db_name" }}'
   ```

Replicated recommends using a template function for the URI, as shown above, to avoid exposing sensitive information. For more information about template functions, see [About Template Functions](/reference/template-functions-about).

### Analyzers

<PreflightsAddAnalyzers/>

```yaml
spec:
  collectors:
    - mysql:
        collectorName: mysql
        uri: 'repl{{ ConfigOption "db_user" }}:repl{{ConfigOption "db_password" }}@tcp(repl{{ ConfigOption "db_host" }}:repl{{ConfigOption "db_port" }})/repl{{ ConfigOption "db_name" }}'
  analyzers:
    - mysql:
        checkName: Must be MySQL 8.x or later
        collectorName: mysql
        outcomes:
          - fail:
              when: connected == false
              message: Cannot connect to MySQL server
          - fail:
              when: version < 8.x
              message: The MySQL server must be at least version 8
          - pass:
              message: The MySQL server is ready
```

<AnalyzersNote/>

### `strict` Analyzers

<PreflightsAddStrict/> 

For more information about cluster privileges, see `requireMinimalRBACPrivileges` for name-scoped access in [Configuring Role-Based Access](packaging-rbac#namespace-scoped-access).

The following example shows the `strict` field set to `true` for MySQL versions:

```yaml
spec:
  collectors:
    - mysql:
        collectorName: mysql
        uri: 'repl{{ ConfigOption "db_user" }}:repl{{ConfigOption "db_password" }}@tcp(repl{{ ConfigOption "db_host" }}:repl{{ConfigOption "db_port" }})/repl{{ ConfigOption "db_name" }}'
  analyzers:
    - mysql:
        strict: true
        checkName: Must be MySQL 8.x or later
        collectorName: mysql
        outcomes:
          - fail:
              when: connected == false
              message: Cannot connect to MySQL server
          - fail:
              when: version < 8.x
              message: The MySQL server must be at least version 8
          - pass:
              message: The MySQL server is ready
```

## Example

The following example shows a preflight support bundle specification wrapped in a Secret for a KOTS installation. For more examples, see the [Troubleshoot example repository](https://github.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot/tree/main/examples/preflight) in GitHub.

```yaml

## Next Step

Save and promote the release to a development environment to test your changes. For more information about installing with KOTS, see [About Installing an Application](/enterprise/installing-overview).
