(Recommended) Add application Pod logs and set the collection limits for the number of lines logged. Typically the selector attribute is matched to the labels.

1. To get the labels for an application, either inspect the YAML or run the following command to see what labels are used:

    ```
    kubectl get pods --show-labels
    ```

1. After the labels are discovered, create collectors to include logs from these pods in a bundle. Depending on the complexity of an application's labeling schema, you might need a few different declarations of the logs collector. You can include the `logs` collector specification multiple times.

    The limits field can support `maxAge` or `maxLines`. This limits the output to the constraints provided. **Default:** `maxLines: 10000`
