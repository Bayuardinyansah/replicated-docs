# Performing Updates in Embedded Clusters (Beta)

This topic describes how to perform updates for [Replicated Embedded Cluster](/vendor/embedded-overview) installations.

:::note
Embedded cluster is in beta. If you are instead looking for information about Replicated kURL, see [Performing Updates in kURL Clusters](updating-kurl).
:::

## Overview

When you update an application installed with Embedded Cluster, you update both the application and the cluster infrastructure together, including Kubernetes, KOTS, and other components running in the cluster. There is no need or mechanism to update the infrastructure on its own.

When you deploy a new version, any changes to the application are deployed first. The Admin Console waits until the application is ready (as indicated by status informers) before making any changes to the cluster. For more information about status informers, see [About Resource Status Informers](/vendor/admin-console-display-app-status).

During cluster updates, the Admin Console can experience downtime and become unavailable if the Kubernetes version is updated. If you are viewing the Admin Console when the downtime occurs, you will see a message that a cluster update is in progress and that the connection will resume after the Admin Console is available again:

## Update

You can update both the application and the infrastructure at the same time from the Admin Console. You can also set up automatic updates. See [Configuring Automatic Updates](/enterprise/updating-apps).

:::important
Do not downgrade the Embedded Cluster version. This is not supported but is not prohibited, and it can lead to unexpected behavior.
