# Step 8: Create a New Version

In this step, you make an edit to the Replicated Config custom resource manifest file in the `replicated-cli-tutorial/manifests` directory for the `cli-tutorial` application to create a new field on the admin console configuration page.

You then create and promote a new release to the Unstable channel with your changes.

To create and promote a new version of the application:

1. In your local directory, go to the the `replicated-cli-tutorial/manifests` folder and open the `kots-config.yaml` file in a text editor.

1. Copy and paste the following YAML into the file to create a new text field on the admin console configuration page:

   ```yaml
    - name: more_text
      title: Another Text Example
      type: text
      value: ""
      when: repl{{ ConfigOptionEquals "show_text_inputs" "1" }}
   ```

1. Open the `example-configmap.yaml` file. Update the `<body>` section in the `example-configmap.yaml` file to create a reference to the `more_text` field using a Replicated template function:

   ```
   <body>
     This is an example KOTS application.
     <p>This is text from a user config value: '{{repl ConfigOption "example_default_value"}}' </p>
     <p>This is more text from a user config value: '{{repl ConfigOption "more_text"}}' </p>
     This is a hidden value: '{{repl ConfigOption "hidden_text"}}'
   </body>
   ```
   The ConfigOption template function renders the user input from the configuration item that you specify. For more information, see [Config Context](/reference/template-functions-config-context) in _Reference_.

1. Save your changes, then run the following command to verify that there are no errors in the YAML:

   ```
   replicated release lint --yaml-dir=manifests
   ```

1. Run the following command to create a new release and promote it to the Unstable channel:

   ```
   replicated release create --auto
   ```

   ***Example output**:

   ```
   • Reading manifests from ./manifests ✓
   • Creating Release ✓
     • SEQUENCE: 2
   • Promoting ✓
     • Channel 2GxpUm7lyB2g0ramqUXqjpLHzK0 successfully set to release 2
   ```

1. Type `y` and press Enter to continue with the defaults.

   **Example output**:

  ```
  RULE    TYPE    FILENAME    LINE    MESSAGE

  • Reading manifests from ./manifests ✓
  • Creating Release ✓
    • SEQUENCE: 2
  • Promoting ✓
    • Channel 2GmYFUFzj8JOSLYw0jAKKJKFua8 successfully set to release 2
  ```

  The release is created and promoted to the Unstable channel with `SEQUENCE: 2`.

After promoting the release with your changes, return to the admin console to update the application to the new version. Continue to [Step 9: Update the Application](tutorial-cli-update-app).
