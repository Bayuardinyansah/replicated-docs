# Step 3: Get the Sample Manifests

To create a release with the replicated CLI, you must have the YAML manifest files for the application in a directory.
This step shows you how to download sample manifest files from https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated-starter-kots and initialize a Git repository for the application.

To get the sample manifest files and initialize the application repository:

1. Run the following command to create and change to a directory for your project:

  ```
  mkdir replicated-cli-tutorial
  cd replicated-cli-tutorial
  ```

1. Run the following command to make a `/manifests` directory for the application manifests and download the starter YAML from https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated-starter-kots:

  ```
  mkdir ./manifests
  curl -fSsL https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots-default-yaml/archive/v2020-09-03.tar.gz | \
    tar xzv --strip-components=1 -C ./manifests \
    --exclude README.md --exclude LICENSE --exclude .gitignore
  ```

1. Run the following command to verify that you can see the YAML files in the `replicated-cli-tutorial/manifests` folder:

  ```
  ls manifests/
  ```

  In the ouput, you can see the following files:

  ```
  config-map.yaml     deployment.yaml     preflight.yaml      service.yaml
  config.yaml         ingress.yaml        replicated-app.yaml support-bundle.yaml
  ```
