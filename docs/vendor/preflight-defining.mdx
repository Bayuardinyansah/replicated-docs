# Defining Preflight Checks

This topic describes how to define preflight checks in Helm- and standard Kubernetes manifest-based applications. For more information about preflight checks, see [About Preflight Checks and Support Bundles](/vendor/preflight-support-bundle-about).

The information in this topic applies to applications that are installed with the Helm CLI or with Replicated KOTS.

## Step 1: Create the Manifest File

You can define preflight checks in a Kubernetes Secret or in a Preflight custom resource. The type of manifest file that you use depends on your application type (Helm- or standard manifest-based) and the installation methods that your application supports (Helm CLI, KOTS v1.101.0 or later, or KOTS v1.100.3 or earlier).

* **Helm-Based Applications**: For Helm-based applications, see the following guidance:

   * **(Recommended) Helm CLI or KOTS v1.101.0 or Later**: For Helm-based applications installed with the Helm CLI or KOTS v1.101.0 or later, define the preflight checks in a Kubernetes Secret in your Helm chart `templates`. See [Kubernetes Secret](#secret).

   * **KOTS v1.100.3 or Earlier**: For Helm-based applications installed with KOTS v1.100.3 or earlier, define the preflight checks in a Preflight custom resource. See [Preflight Custom Resource](#preflight-cr).

* **Standard Manifest-Based Applications**: For standard manifest-based applications, define the preflight checks in a Preflight custom resource. See [Preflight Custom Resource](#preflight-cr).

### Kubernetes Secret {#secret}

For Helm-based applications installed with the Helm CLI or KOTS v1.101.0 or later, define preflight checks in a Kubernetes Secret in your Helm chart `templates`. This allows you to define the preflights spec only one time to support running preflight checks in both Helm CLI and KOTS installations. 

For a tutorial that demonstrates how to define preflight checks in a Secret in chart `templates` and then run the preflight checks in both Helm CLI and KOTS installations, see [Tutorial: Add Preflight Checks to a Helm Chart](/vendor/tutorial-preflight-helm-setup).

Add the following YAML to a Kubernetes Secret in your Helm chart `templates` directory:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  labels:
    troubleshoot.sh/kind: preflight
  name: "{{ .Release.Name }}-preflight-config"
stringData:
  preflight.yaml: |
    apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
    kind: Preflight
    metadata:
      name: preflight-sample
    spec:
      collectors: []
      analyzers: []
```

As shown above, the Secret must include the following:

* The label `troubleshoot.sh/kind: preflight`
* A `stringData` field with a key named `preflight.yaml` so that the preflight binary can use this Secret when it runs from the CLI

### Preflight Custom Resource {#preflight-cr}

Define preflight checks in a Preflight custom resource for the following installation types:
* Standard manifest-based applications installed with any version of KOTS
* Helm-based applications installed with KOTS v1.100.3 and earlier
    :::note
    For Helm charts installed with KOTS v1.101.0 and later, Replicated recommends that you define preflight checks in a Secret in the Helm chart `templates` instead of using the Preflight custom resource. See [Create a Secret](#secret) above.

    In KOTS v1.101.0 and later, preflights defined in the Helm chart override the Preflight custom resource used by KOTS. During installation, if KOTS v1.101.0 and later cannot find preflights specified in the Helm chart archive, then KOTS searches for `kind: Preflight` in the root of the release.
    :::

Add the following YAML to a new file in a release:

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
kind: Preflight
metadata:
  name: preflights
spec:
  collectors: []
  analyzers: []
```

For more information about the Preflight custom resource, see [Preflight and Support Bundle](/reference/custom-resource-preflight).

## Step 2: Define Collectors and Analyzers

This section describes how to define collectors and analyzers for preflight checks based on your application needs. You add the collectors and analyzers that you want to use in the `spec.collectors` and `spec.analyzers` keys in the manifest file that you created.

For examples of collectors and analyzers defined in Kubernetes Secrets and Preflight custom resources, see [Example Specifications](#example-specifications) below. 

### Collectors

Collectors gather information from the cluster, the environment, the application, or other sources. Collectors generate output that is then used by the analyzers that you define to generate results for the preflight checks. 

The following default collectors are included automatically to gather information about the cluster and cluster resources:
* [clusterInfo](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/collect/cluster-info/)
* [clusterResources](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/collect/cluster-resources/)

You do not need manually include the `clusterInfo` or `clusterResources` collectors in the specification. To use only the `clusterInfo` and `clusterResources` collectors, delete the `spec.collectors` key from the preflight specification.

The Troubleshoot open source project includes several additional collectors that you can include in the specification to gather more information from the installation environment. To view all the available collectors, see [All Collectors](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/collect/all/) in the Troubleshoot documentation.

### Analyzers

Analyzers use the output from the collectors to generate results for the preflight checks, including the criteria for pass, fail, and warn outcomes and custom messages for each outcome.

For example, in a preflight check that checks the version of Kubernetes running in the target cluster, the analyzer can define a fail outcome when the cluster is running a version of Kubernetes less than 1.25 that includes the following custom message to the user: `The application requires Kubernetes 1.25.0 or later, and recommends 1.27.0`.

The Troubleshoot open source project includes several analyzers that you can include in your preflight check specification. The following are some of the analyzers in the Troubleshoot project that use the default `clusterInfo` or `clusterResources` collectors:
* [clusterPodStatuses](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/analyze/cluster-pod-statuses/)
* [clusterVersion](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/analyze/cluster-version/)
* [deploymentStatus](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/analyze/deployment-status/)
* [distribution](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/analyze/distribution/)
* [nodeResources](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/analyze/node-resources/)
* [statefulsetStatus](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/analyze/stateful-set-status/)
* [storageClass](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/analyze/storage-class/)

To view all the available analyzers, see the [Analyze](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/analyze/) section of the Troubleshoot documentation.

### (KOTS Only) Block Installation with Required Preflights {#strict}

For applications installed with KOTS, you can set any preflight analyzer to `strict: true`. When `strict: true` is set, any `fail` outcomes for the analyzer block the deployment of the release.

:::note
Strict preflight analyzers are ignored if the `exclude` property is also included and evaluates to `true`. See [exclude](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/analyze/#exclude) in the Troubleshoot documentation.

## Example Specifications

This section includes common examples of preflight check specifications. For more examples, see the [Troubleshoot example repository](https://github.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot/tree/main/examples/preflight) in GitHub.

### Check MySQL Version Using Template Functions

The examples below use the `mysql` collector and the `mysql` analyzer to check the version of MySQL running in the cluster.

For more information, see [Collect > MySQL](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/collect/mysql/) and [Analyze > MySQL](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/analyze/mysql/) in the Troubleshoot documentation.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="secret" label="Kubernetes Secret" default>
    <p>This example uses Helm template functions to render the credentials and connection details for the MySQL server that were supplied by the user. Additionally, it uses Helm template functions to create a conditional statement so that the MySQL collector and analyzer are included in the preflight checks only when MySQL is deployed, as indicated by a <code>.Values.global.mysql.enabled</code> field evaluating to true.</p>

For more information about template functions, see <a href="/reference/template-functions-about">About Template Functions</a>.</p>
