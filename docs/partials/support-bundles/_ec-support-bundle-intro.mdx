Embedded Cluster includes a default support bundle spec that can be used to collect both cluster- and host-level information.

The host-level information provided is useful for troubleshooting failures related to host configuration like DNS, networking, or storage problems. Cluster-level information includes details about the components provided by Replicated, such as the Admin Console and Embedded Cluster operator that manage install and upgrade operations. If the cluster has not installed successfully and cluster-level information is not available, then it is excluded from the bundle.

After generating a support bundle using the default spec, you can use the bundle for troubleshooting or provide it to Replicated for assistance.
