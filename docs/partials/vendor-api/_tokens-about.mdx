The Vendor API v3 is the API that manages applications in the Replicated vendor portal. The replicated CLI is an implementation of the Vendor API v3.

Using the replicated CLI and Vendor API V3 requires an API token for authorization. Tokens are primarily used for automated customer, channel, and release management. You create tokens in the vendor portal.

The following types of token are available:

- [Service Accounts](#service-accounts)
- [User API Tokens](user-api-tokens)

:::note
Team API tokens are deprecated and cannot be generated. If you are already using team API tokens, Replicated recommends that you migrate to Service Accounts or User API tokens instead because these options provide better granular control over token access.
