Clusters created with the compatiblity matrix are billed by the minute. Per-minute billing begins when the cluster reaches a Ready state and ends when the cluster is deleted. The compatibility matrix marks a cluster as Ready when a working kubeconfig for the cluster is accessible.

You are billed only for the time that the cluster is in a Ready state. You are not billed for the time that it takes the compatibility matrix to create and tear down clusters.

To create clusters with the compatibility matrix, you must have credits in your vendor portal account. 
To request credits, log in to the vendor portal and go to [Compatibility Matrix > Request more credits](https://vendor.replicated.com/compatibility-matrix).
