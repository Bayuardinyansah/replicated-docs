To deploy Helm charts, KOTS requires a HelmChart custom resource for each Helm chart that you add to a release. You configure the HelmChart custom resource to provide the necessary instructions to KOTS for processing and preparing the chart for deployment. The HelmChart custom resource also creates a mapping between the `values.yaml` file in the Helm chart and the Replicated admin console Config page. This allows values to be changed in the chart based on user-provided configuration settings.
