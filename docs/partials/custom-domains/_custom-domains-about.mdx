You can use custom domains to alias Replicated endpoints by creating Canonical Name (CNAME) records for your domains.

Replicated domains are external to your domain and can require additional security reviews by your customer. Using custom domains as aliases can bring the domains inside an existing security review and reduce your exposure.

TXT records must be created to verify:

- Domain ownership: Domain ownership is verified when you initially add a record.
- TLS certificate creation: Each new domain must have a new TLS certificate to be verified.

The TXT records can be removed after the verification is complete.

You can configure custom domains for the following registries and services, so that customer-facing URLs reflect your company's brand:

- **Replicated registry:** Images and Helm charts can be pulled from the Replicated registry. By default, this registry uses the domain `registry.replicated.com`. For more information, see [Push Images to the Replicated Private Registry](private-images-replicated).

- **Proxy service:** Images can be proxied from external private registries using the Replicated proxy service. By default, the proxy service uses the domain `proxy.replicated.com`. For more information about configuring domains, see [Using Custom Domains for Private Registries](custom-domains). For more information, see [About the Proxy Service](private-images-about#about-the-proxy-service) in _About Using an External Registry_.

- **replicated.app:** Upstream application YAML and metadata, including a license ID, are pulled from replicated.app. By default, this service uses the domain `replicated.app`. For more information about configuring domains, see [Using Custom Domains for Private Registries](custom-domains). For more information, see [Firewall Openings for Online Installations](/enterprise/installing-general-requirements#firewall-openings-for-online-installations) in _Installation Requirements_.

- **Download portal:** The download portal can be used to share customer license files. For more information about customizing the download portal domain, see [Using a Custom Domain for the Download Portal](custom-domains-download-portal).
