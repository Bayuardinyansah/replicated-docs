This topic describes how to perform updates for [Replicated Embedded Cluster](/vendor/embedded-overview) installations. For information about how to set up automatic updates, see [Configuring Automatic Updates](/enterprise/updating-apps).

## Overview

When you update an application installed with Embedded Cluster, you update both the application and the cluster infrastructure together, including Kubernetes, KOTS, and other components running in the cluster. There is no need or mechanism to update the infrastructure on its own.

When you deploy a new version, any changes to the application are deployed first. The Admin Console waits until the application is ready (as indicated by status informers) before making any changes to the cluster. For more information about status informers, see [About Resource Status Informers](/vendor/insights-app-status).

Any changes made to the Embedded Cluster Config, including changes to the Embedded Cluster version, Helm extensions, and unsupported overrides, trigger a cluster update.

When performing an upgrade with Embedded Cluster, the user is able to change the application config before deploying the new version. Additionally, the user's license is synced automatically. 

## Update

:::important
Do not downgrade the Embedded Cluster version. This is not supported but is not prohibited, and it can lead to unexpected behavior.

To perform an update with Embedded Cluster:

1. In the Admin Console, go to the **Version history** tab.

   All versions available for upgrade are listed in the **Available Updates** section:

   During cluster updates, the Admin Console can experience downtime and become unavailable if the Kubernetes version is updated. When viewing the Admin Console when the downtime occurs, the user sees a message that a cluster update is in progress and that the connection will resume after the Admin Console is available again:
