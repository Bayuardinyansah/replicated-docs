# Replicated FAQs

This topic lists frequently-asked questions (FAQs) for the Replicated Platform.

## Platform FAQs

### What application packaging options are supported for applications distributed with Replicated?

Replicated strongly recommends that all applications are packaged using Helm because many enterprise customers expect to be able to install an application with Helm in their own cluster.

<Helm/>

For vendors that do not want to use Helm, applications distributed with Replicated can be packaged as Kubernetes manifest files. Applications packaged as Kubernetes manifests can be installed with the Replicated installers (Replicated Embedded Cluster and Replicated KOTS).

### What are the different installation options for applications distributed with Replicated?

The following can be used to install applications distributed with Replicated:
* **Replicated Embedded Cluster**: Emebdded Cluster supports installation on VMs or bare metal servers in online (internet-connected) or air gap environments
* **Helm**: Applications packaged with Helm can be installed in internet-connected clusters using the Helm CLI 
* **Replicated KOTS**: KOTS supports installation in online or air gap clusters. 

It is not necessary to create and manage separate release directories for each type of installation; a single release in the Replicated Vendor Portal can be configured to support installation with the Helm CLI and Replicated installers.

For a tutorial that demonstrates how to add the Bitnami Gitea Helm chart to a release in the Replicated Vendor Portal and then install with both KOTS and the Helm CLI, see [Install a Helm Chart with KOTS and Helm CLI](/vendor/tutorial-kots-helm-setup).

## Compatibility Matrix FAQs

### What types of clusters can I create with Compatibility Matrix?

Compatibility Matrix supports a variety of VM and cloud distributions, including Red Hat OpenShift, Replicated Embedded Cluster, and Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE). For a complete list, see [Supported Compatibility Matrix Cluster Types](/vendor/testing-supported-clusters).

### How does billing work?

Clusters created with Compatibility Matrix are billed by the minute. Per-minute billing begins when the cluster reaches a running status and ends when the cluster is deleted. For more information, see [Billing and Credits](/vendor/testing-about#billing-and-credits).

### How do I buy credits?

To create clusters with Compatibility Matrix, you must have credits in your Vendor Portal account. If you have a contract, you can purchase credits by logging in to the Vendor Portal and going to **[Compatibility Matrix > Buy additional credits](https://vendor.replicated.com/compatibility-matrix)**. Otherwise, to request credits, log in to the Vendor Portal and go to **[Compatibility Matrix > Request more credits](https://vendor.replicated.com/compatibility-matrix)**.

### How do I add Comaptibility Matrix to my CI/CD pipelines?

You can use Replicated CLI commands to integrate Compatibility Matrix into your CI/CD development and production workflows. This allows you to programmatically create multiple different types of clusters where you can deploy and test your application before releasing.

For more information, see [About Integrating with CI/CD](/vendor/ci-overview).

## KOTS and Embedded Cluster FAQs

### What is the Admin Console?

### How do Embedded Cluster installations on VMs or bare metal servers work?

Users run an Embedded Cluster installation command on their VM or bare metal server that provisions a cluster. Embedded Cluster also installs KOTS in the cluster, which deploys the Admin Console.

Users log in to the Admin Console to provide application-specific configuration values, optionally join more nodes to the cluster, run preflight checks, and finally install the application.

For more information, see [Installing with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/installing-embedded).

### What's the difference between Embedded Cluster and kURL?

Replicated Embedded Cluster is a successor to Replicated kURL. Compared to kURL, Embedded Cluster feature offers significantly faster installation, updates, and node joins, a redesigned Admin Console UI, improved support for multi-node clusters, one-click updates that update the application and the cluster at the same time, and more.

For more information, see [Using Embedded Cluster](/vendor/embedded-overview) or [Introduction to kURL](/vendor/kurl-about).

### What do I have to do to enable Embedded Cluster installations for my application?

Enabling Embedded Cluster installations requires that the Replicated KOTS entitlement is assigned to your Vendor Portal team.

Releases that support installation with Embedded Cluster include the Embedded Cluster Config, as well as the manifests required by the KOTS installer to define the Admin Console experience and install the application.

For more information, see [Onboarding with KOTS](/vendor/distributing-workflow).

### Can I use my own branding for Embedded Cluster and KOTS installations?

The KOTS Admin Console and the Replicated Customer Portal support the use of a custom logo. Additionally, software vendors can use custom domains to alias the endpoints for Replicated services.

For more information, see [Customizing the Admin Console and Customer Portal](/vendor/admin-console-customize-app-icon) and [About Custom Domains](custom-domains).

### Does Replicated support installations into air gap environments?

Yes. Software vendors can use KOTS to generate air gap bundles for installation into air gap environments. KOTS also provides customer-specific download portals where air gap bundles and license files can be shared with enterprise users.

Air gap installations are supported for existing and embedded clusters.

### Can I deploy Helm charts with KOTS?

Yes. An application deployed with KOTS can use one or more Helm charts, can include Helm charts as components, and can use more than a single instance of any Helm chart. Each Helm chart deployed by KOTS requires a unique HelmChart custom resource (`apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta2`) in the release.

For more information, see [About Distributing Helm Charts with KOTS](/vendor/helm-native-about).

## Replicated SDK FAQs

### Is the SDK supported in air gap environments?

Yes. The SDK can be installed in air gap mode to run in environments with no outbound internet access.

### How should I develop against the SDK?

You can install the SDK in development mode to quickly integrate and test when developing against the SDK API.

### How does the Replicated SDK work with KOTS?

The Replicated SDK is a Helm chart that can be installed as a small service alongside an application, or as a standalone component. The SDK can be installed using the Helm CLI or KOTS.

Replicated recommends that all applications include the SDK because it provides access to key functionality not available through KOTS, such as support for sending custom metrics from application instances. When both the SDK and KOTS are installed in a cluster alongside an application, both send instance telemetry to the Vendor Portal.

For more information, see [Installing the Replicated SDK](/vendor/replicated-sdk-installing).
