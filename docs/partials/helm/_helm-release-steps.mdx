The following steps demonstrate how to create and promote a release using the vendor portal. You can also create and promote releases with the replicated CLI. For more information, see [Managing Releases with the CLI](releases-creating-cli).

To create and promote a release with your Helm chart in the vendor portal:

1. In the vendor portal, go to **Releases** > **Create a release**.

1. Do one of the following to add your Helm chart to the release:

   * In the **Upload Helm chart** modal, upload your Helm chart `.tgz` file.
     
     ![upload helm chart modal](/images/upload-helm-chart-modal.png)

   * If the **Upload Helm chart** modal does not appear, drag and drop your Helm chart `.tgz` file from your local directory into the file tree.

   Your Helm chart files appear in the file tree of the release.

1. If you are prompted to select a Helm install method, click **OK**. This option is relevant only for releases distributed with KOTS.

1. Click **Save Release** then click **Promote**. In the **Promote Release** dialog, edit the following fields:
   1. For **Channel**, select the channel that your team uses for development. If you are not sure which channel to use, use the default Unstable channel.
   1. (Optional) For **Release notes**, add release notes to describe the updates in this release.

After the release is promoted, the vendor portal automatically pushes your Helm chart to the Replicated registry. For information about how to install the release in a development environment with Helm, see [Installing an Application with Helm (Beta)](install-with-helm).
