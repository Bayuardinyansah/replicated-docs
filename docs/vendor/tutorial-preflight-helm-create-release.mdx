# Step 3: Add the Chart Archive to a Release

Add the Gitea Helm chart archive to a release for an application in the Replicated vendor platform.

To create a release:

1. Install the replicated CLI:

   ```
   brew install replicatedhq/replicated/cli
   ```
   For more installation options, see [Installing the replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).

1. Authorize the replicated CLI:

   ```
   replicated login
   ```
   In the browser window that opens, complete the prompts to log in to your vendor account and authorize the CLI.

1. Create an application named `Gitea`:

   ```
   replicated app create Gitea
   ```

1. Get the slug for the application that you created:

   ```
   replicated app ls
   ```
   **Example output**:
   ```
   ID                             NAME            SLUG            SCHEDULER
   2WthxUIfGT13RlrsUx9HR7So8bR    Gitea           gitea-boxer     kots
   ```
   In the example above, the application slug is `gitea-boxer`.

   :::note
   The application _slug_ is a unique string that is generated based on the application name. You can use the application slug to interact with the application through the replicated CLI and the Vendor API v3. The application name and slug are often different from one another because it is possible to create more than one application with the same name.
   :::

1. Set the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable to the application that you created. This allows you to interact with the application using the replicated CLI without needing to use the `--app` flag with every command:

   **Example:**

   ```
   export REPLICATED_APP=gitea-boxer
   ```

1. Go to the `gitea` directory.

1. Create a release with the Gitea chart archive:

   ```
   replicated release create --chart=gitea-1.0.6.tgz
   ```
   ```bash
   You are creating a release that will only be installable with the helm CLI.

   ```

1. Log in to the vendor portal and go to **Releases**.

    The release that you created is listed under **All releases**.

1. Click **View YAML** to view the files in the release.

1. At the top of the page, click **Promote**.

1. In the dialog, for **Which channels you would like to promote this release to?**, select **Unstable**. Unstable is a default channel that is intended for use with internal testing.

1. For **Version label**, open the dropdown and select **1.0.6**.

1. Click **Promote**.
