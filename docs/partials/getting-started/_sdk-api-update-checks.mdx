The Replicated SDK provides an in-cluster API that can be used to integrate Replicated functionality with your application.

The Replicated SDK API `api/v1/app/updates` endpoint returns details about new releases that are available to an instance for upgrade. You can use the `api/v1/app/updates` endpoint to allow users to easily check for available updates for your application.

To do so, you can use the Replicated SDK in integration mode to develop locally against the SDK API without needing to make real changes in the Vendor Portal or in your environment.
