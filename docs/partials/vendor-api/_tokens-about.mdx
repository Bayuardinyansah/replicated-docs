The Vendor API v3 is the API to manage applications, releases, customers, licenses, and everything related to an application managed by the Replicated vendor portal.

The [replicated CLI](replicated-cli-installing) is an implementation of the Vendor API v3.

Using the [replicated CLI](replicated-cli-installing) and [Vendor REST API](vendor-api-using) requires a token for authorization.
Tokens are created in the vendor portal. 

The following types of tokens are available:

- **Service Accounts:** Independent RBAC Policies, useful for operations that are not tied to a particular user (such as CI/CD or integrations).
- **User API Tokens:** Tied to a user account so the user inherits the RBAC policy and only exists if the user exists in the team. Any changes to the user's RBAC are applied to all User API Tokens.

:::note
Team API tokens are deprecated and cannot be generated. However, you can migrate to Service Accounts instead.
