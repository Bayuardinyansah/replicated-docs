Before you can create your first release with Replicated, you must create a new application and export the environment variables. You only need to do this procedure once for each application that you want to deploy.

To create a new application:

1. Run the following command to create a new application:

    ```
    replicated app create APP_NAME
    ```

    Replace APP_NAME with the name of the application.

1. Export the application slug in the output of the `app create` command as an environment variable:

  ```
  export REPLICATED_APP=YOUR_SLUG
  ```
  Replace `YOUR_SLUG` with the slug for the application you created in the previous step.

1. Verify that both the `REPLICATED_API_TOKEN` environment variable that you created in step 1 and the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable are set correctly:

  ```
  replicated release ls
  ```

  In the output of this command, you see an empty list of releases for the new application:

  ```
  SEQUENCE    CREATED    EDITED    ACTIVE_CHANNELS
  ```
