# Kubernetes installer requirements

KOTS leverages [kURL](https://kurl.sh/) to embed a new Kubernetes cluster into existing machines.
As such, any embedded installation includes additional system requirements (see [kURL System Requirements](https://kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/system-requirements)).

Root access *is* required for embedded cluster installations.
