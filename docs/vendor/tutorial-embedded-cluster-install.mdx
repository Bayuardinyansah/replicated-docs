# Step 6: Install the Release on a VM

Next, get the customer-specific embedded cluster installation commands and then install the release on a Linux VM.

To install the release with embedded cluster:

1. In the [vendor portal](https://vendor.replicated.com), go to **Customers**. Click on the name of the customer you created.

1. Click **Install instructions > Embedded cluster**. The **Embedded cluster install instructions** dialog opens.

1. SSH onto your Linux VM.

1. On the command line, run the first command in the **Embedded cluster install instructions** to download the release.

1. Run the second command in the dialog to extract the release:

    ```bash
    tar -xvzf gitea-unstable.tgz
    ```

1. Run the third command to install the release:

    ```bash
    sudo ./gitea install --license license.yaml
    ```

1. When prompted, enter a password for accessing the KOTS admin console.

    The installation command takes about three minutes to complete.

1. When the installation command completes, go to the URL provided in the output of the command to log in to the admin console.

    **Example output:**

    ```bash
    ✔  Host files materialized
    ? Enter an Admin Console password: ********
    ? Confirm password: ********
    ✔  Node installation finished
    ✔  Storage is ready!
    ✔  Embedded Cluster Operator is ready!
    ✔  Velero is ready!
    ✔  Admin Console is ready!
    ✔  Finished!
    Visit the admin console to configure and install gitea: http://104.155.145.60:30000
    ```

1. Bypass the browser TLS warning.

1. On the **HTTPS for the Gitea admin console** page, select **Self-signed** and click **Continue**.

1. On the login page, enter the password that you created.

1. On the **Nodes** page, you can view details about the VM where you installed, including its node role, status, CPU, and memory. Users can also optionally add additional nodes on this page before deploying the application. Click **Continue**. 

    The admin console dashboard opens. The application status changes from Missing, to Unavailable, to Ready while the `gitea` Deployment is being created:

## Next Step

Install the same release with the Helm CLI. See [Step 7: View Instance Reporting Data](tutorial-embedded-cluster-reporting).
