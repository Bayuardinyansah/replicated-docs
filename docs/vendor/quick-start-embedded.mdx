# Embedded Cluster Quick Start

Welcome! This topic provides a quick start workflow to help you get started with Replicated KOTS and the Replicated Embedded Cluster installer.

## Objectives

The goals of this quick start are to introduce new Replicated users to the following common tasks:
* Working with applications, channels, releases, and customers in the Replicated Vendor Portal and Replicated CLI
* Testing and iterating on releases by installing in a development environment

Understanding these tasks will help you when you begin the process of onboarding your application to the Replicated Platform.

## Set Up the Environment

Before you begin, complete the following prerequisites:

* Prepare your development environment by ensuring you have access to a VM where you can test the installation and upgrade processes for Embedded Cluster.

## Quick Start Workflow

To get started with KOTS and Embedded Cluster:

1. Create an account in the Vendor Portal. You can either create a new team or join an existing team. For more information, see [Creating a Vendor Account](vendor-portal-creating-account).

1. Create an application:

   1. On your local machine, install the Replicated CLI:

   ```
   brew install replicatedhq/replicated/cli
   ```
   For more installation options, see [Installing the Replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).

   1. Authorize the Replicated CLI:

      ```
      replicated login
      ```
      In the browser window that opens, complete the prompts to log in to your vendor account and authorize the CLI.

   1. Create an application named `Gitea`:

      ```
      replicated app create Gitea
      ```

   1. Set the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable to the application that you created. This allows you to interact with the application using the Replicated CLI without needing to use the `--app` flag with every command:

      1. Get the slug for the application that you created:

         ```
         replicated app ls
         ```
         **Example output**:
         ```
         ID                             NAME            SLUG           SCHEDULER
         2WthxUIfGT13RlrsUx9HR7So8bR    Gitea           gitea-kite     kots
         ```
         In the example above, the application slug is `gitea-kite`.

      1. Set the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable to the application slug.

         **Example:**

         ```
         export REPLICATED_APP=gitea-kite
         ```

1. Get the sample Helm chart and add the Replicated SDK as a dependency:

   1. Run the following command to pull and untar version 1.0.6 of the Bitnami Gitea Helm chart:

      ```
      helm pull --untar oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/gitea --version 1.0.6
      ```
      For more information about this chart, see the [bitnami/gitea](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/gitea) repository in GitHub.

   1. Change to the new `gitea` directory that was created:
      
      ```
      cd gitea
      ```

   1. In the Helm chart `Chart.yaml`, add the Replicated SDK as a dependency:

      <DependencyYaml/>

      The Replicated SDK is a Helm chart that provides access to Replicated features and can be installed as a small service alongside your application. For more information, see [About the Replicated SDK](/vendor/replicated-sdk-overview).

   1. Update dependencies and package the Helm chart to a `.tgz` chart archive:

      <HelmPackage/>

      <UnauthorizedError/>

1. Create a release:

   1. In the `gitea` directory, create a subdirectory named `manifests`:

   ```
   mkdir manifests
   ```

   You will add the files required to support installation with Replicated KOTS to this subdirectory.

1. Move the Helm chart archive that you created to `manifests`:

   ```
   mv gitea-1.0.6.tgz manifests
   ```

1. In `manifests`, create the YAML manifests required by KOTS and Embedded Cluster:
   ```
   cd manifests
   ```
   ```
   touch gitea.yaml kots-app.yaml k8s-app.yaml embedded-cluster.yaml
   ```

1. In each of the files that you created, paste the corresponding YAML provided in the tabs below:

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem value="helmchart" label="gitea.yaml" default>
    <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>The KOTS HelmChart custom resource provides instructions to KOTS about how to deploy the Helm chart. The <code>name</code> and <code>chartVersion</code> listed in the HelmChart custom resource must match the name and version of a Helm chart archive in the release. The <a href="/vendor/helm-optional-value-keys#conditionally-set-values"><code>optionalValues</code></a> field sets the specified Helm values when a given conditional statement evaluates to true. In this case, if the application is installed with Embedded Cluster, then the Gitea service type is set to `NodePort` and the node port is set to `"32000"`. This will allow Gitea to be accessed from the local machine after deployment.</p>
    <h5>YAML</h5>
    <HelmChartCr/>
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="kots-app" label="kots-app.yaml">
   <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>The KOTS Application custom resource enables features in the Replicated Admin Console such as branding, release notes, application status indicators, and custom graphs.</p><p>The YAML below provides a name for the application to display in the Admin Console, adds a custom <em>status informer</em> that displays the status of the <code>gitea</code> Deployment resource in the Admin Console dashboard, adds a custom application icon, and adds the port where the Gitea service can be accessed so that the user can open the application after installation.</p>
    <h5>YAML</h5>
    <KotsCr/>
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="k8s-app" label="k8s-app.yaml">
   <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>The Kubernetes Application custom resource supports functionality such as including buttons and links on the Replicated Admin Console dashboard. The YAML below adds an <strong>Open App</strong> button to the Admin Console dashboard that opens the application using the service port defined in the KOTS Application custom resource.</p>
    <h5>YAML</h5>
    <K8sCr/>
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="ec" label="embedded-cluster.yaml">
   <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>To install your application with Embedded Cluster, an Embedded Cluster Config must be present in the release. At minimum, the Embedded Cluster Config sets the version of Embedded Cluster that will be installed. You can also define several characteristics about the cluster.</p>
    <h5>YAML</h5>
    <EcCr/>
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

1. Lint:

   ```bash
   replicated release lint --yaml-dir .
   ```
   ```bash
   RULE                                  TYPE    FILENAME         LINE    MESSAGE
   config-spec                           warn                                                                                                                                                    Missing config spec
   preflight-spec                        warn                                                                                                                                                    Missing preflight spec
   troubleshoot-spec                     warn                                                                                                                                                    Missing troubleshoot spec
   nonexistent-status-informer-object    warn    kots-app.yaml    8       Status informer points to a nonexistent kubernetes object. If this is a Helm resource, this warning can be ignored.
   ```
   :::note
   You can ignore any warning messages for the purpose of this quick start.

1. Create the release and promote it to the Unstable channel:

   ```
   replicated release create --yaml-dir .
   ```
   **Example output**:
   ```
   • Reading manifests from . ✓
   • Creating Release ✓
     • SEQUENCE: 1
   ```

1. Create a customer so that you can install the release on your VM:

    1. Click **Customer > Create customer**.

    1. For **Customer name**, add a name.

    1. For **Channel**, select Unstable. This allows the customer to install releases promoted to the Unstable channel.

    1. For **Customer email**, enter an email address. An email address is required for Helm installations to authenticate with the Replicated registry. This email address is never used to send emails to customers.

    1. Enable the Embedded Cluster license option.

    1. Click **Save Changes**.

1. Install the application with Embedded Cluster:
     
    1. On the page for the customer that you created, click **Install instructions > Embedded Cluster**.
