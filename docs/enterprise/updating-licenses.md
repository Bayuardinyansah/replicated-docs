## Upgrade from a Community License

If you have a community license, you can change your license by uploading a new one. This allows you to upgrade from a community version of the software without having to reinstall the admin console and the application.

To change a community license to another license:

1. In the License tab of the admin console, click **Change license**.
1. In the dialog, upload the new license file that you received from your vendor.
