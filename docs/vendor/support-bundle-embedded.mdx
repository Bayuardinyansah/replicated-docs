# Generating Embedded Cluster Support Bundles (Beta)

This topic describes how to generate a support bundle for Replicated Embedded Cluster installations that includes application-, cluster-, and host-level troubleshooting information.

## Overview

From the shell, you can generate a support bundle for Replicated Embedded Cluster installations to help with troubleshooting.

The default support bundle spec for Embedded Cluster collects host-level information to troubleshoot failures related to host configuration like DNS, networking, or storage problems.

It also collects cluster-level information about the components provided by Replicated, such as the Admin Console and Embedded Cluster operator that manage install and upgrade operations. If the cluster has not installed successfully and cluster-level information is not available, it will be excluded from the bundle.
