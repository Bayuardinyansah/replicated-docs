# Support Lifecycle Policy

Replicated will provide support for products per our terms and services until that product is noted as End of Life (EOL).

| Product Phase                  | Definition           |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| “GA” - General Availability | A product starts the General Availability phase when it is available for purchase from Replicated. |
| “LA” - Limited Availability | A product has reached the Limited Availability phase when it is no longer available for new purchases from Replicated. Updates will be primarily limited to security patches, critical bugs and features that enable migration to GA products.|
| “EOA” - End of Availability | A product has reached the End of Availability phase when it is no longer available for renewal purchase by existing customers. This date may coincide with the Limited Availability phase. This product is considered deprecated, and will move to End of Life after a determined support window. Product maintenance is limited to critical security issues only. |
| “EOL” - End of Life| A product has reached its End of Life, and will no longer be supported, patched, or fixed by Replicated. Associated product documentation may no longer be available. Replicated team will continue to engage to migrate end customers to GA product based deployments of your application. |
