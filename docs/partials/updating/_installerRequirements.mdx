* **`installer-spec-file` flag**: If you used the `installer-spec-file` flag to pass a `patch.yaml` file when you ran the installation script previously, you must include the `installer-spec-file` flag with the same `patch.yaml` file when you rerun the installation script. This prevents the installer from overwriting any configuration from your `patch.yaml` file and making changes to the add-ons in your cluster. For example: `curl https://kurl.sh/latest | sudo bash -s installer-spec-file="./patch.yaml"`

* **`app-version-label` flag**: By default, the KOTS add-on in the Kubernetes installer specification also upgrades your application to the latest version when you run the installation script.

   You can also specify an application version with the `app-version-label` flag. Or, to avoid upgrading your application version, set the `app-version-label` flag to the currently installed application version.

   **For example:**

   ```
   curl https://kurl.sh/latest | sudo bash -s app-version-label=1.5.0
   ```
