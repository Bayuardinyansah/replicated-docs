* If you are installing in high availability (HA) mode, a load balancer is required:

  * If the kURL Installer spec includes the EKCO add-on, you do not need to provide your own external load balancer. If you are going to use the internal load balancer, you can optionally preconfigure it by passing `| sudo bash -s ha ekco-enable-internal-load-balancer` with the kURL install command. Otherwise, you are prompted after running the kURL install command to specify that you want to use the internal load balancer.
  
  * To use an external load balancer, ensure that your load balancer is:
    - A TCP forwarding external load balancer.
    - Configured to distribute traffic to all healthy control plane nodes in its target list.
    
    If you are going to use an external load balancer, you can optionally preconfigured it by passing the `load-balancer-address=HOST:PORT` flag with the kURL install command. Otherwise, you are prompted after running the kURL install command to provide the address for the load balancer.
