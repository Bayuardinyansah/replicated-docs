# Step 3: Get the Sample Manifests

To create a release with the replicated CLI, you must have the YAML manifest files for the application in a directory.
This step shows you how to download a set of sample manifest files for a simple Kubernetes application that deploys an NGINX service.

To view the GitHub repository for the sample application, see [kots-default-yaml](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots-default-yaml).

To get the sample manifest files:

1. Run the following command to create and change to a directory for your project:

  ```
  mkdir replicated-cli-tutorial
  cd replicated-cli-tutorial
  ```

1. Run the following command to make a `/manifests` directory for the application manifests and download the YAML manifest files for the application:

  ```
  mkdir ./manifests
  curl -fSsL https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots-default-yaml/archive/refs/heads/main.zip | \
    tar xzv --strip-components=1 -C ./manifests \
    --exclude README.md --exclude LICENSE --exclude .gitignore
  ```

1. Run the following command to verify that you can see the YAML files in the `replicated-cli-tutorial/manifests` folder:

  ```
  ls manifests/
  ```

  In the `manifests` directory, you can see the following files:

  ```
  example-configmap.yaml   example-service.yaml     kots-app.yaml            kots-lint-config.yaml    kots-support-bundle.yaml
  example-deployment.yaml  k8s-app.yaml             kots-config.yaml         kots-preflight.yaml
  ```
