# Step 3: Add the Preflight Spec to the Chart

Next, add the preflight check specification to the Gitea chart as a Kubernetes Secret. Including the spec in a Secret in the templates of a Helm chart allows preflight checks to be delivered as part of the application.

1. Move the `gitea-preflights.yaml` file to the Gitea `templates` subdirectory:

   ```
   mv gitea-preflights.yaml templates
   ```

1. In the `gitea-preflights.yaml` file, add the following YAML to create a Kubernetes Secret with the preflight check specification that you created: 

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     labels:
       troubleshoot.sh/kind: preflight
     name: gitea-preflight-checks
   stringData:
     preflight.yaml: |
       apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
       kind: Preflight
       metadata:
         name: gitea-preflight-checks
       spec:
         analyzers:
           - clusterVersion:
               outcomes:
                 - fail:
                     when: "< 1.23.0"
                     message: |-
                       Your cluster is running a version of Kubernetes that is not supported and your installation will not succeed. To continue, upgrade your cluster to Kubernetes 1.23.0 or later.
                     uri: https://www.kubernetes.io
                 - pass:
                     message: Your cluster is running the recommended version of Kubernetes.
   ```

1. Package the chart to an archive:

   1. In the `Chart.yaml` file, add the Replicated SDK as a dependency:

      <DependencyYaml/>

   1. Update dependencies and package the chart to a `.tgz` chart archive:

      ```bash
      helm package . --dependency-update
      ```       

## Next Step

Add the chart archive to a release.
