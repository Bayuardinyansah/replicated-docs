Install the KOTS admin console using the images that you pushed in the previous step:

   ```shell
   kubectl kots install APP_NAME \
     --kotsadm-registry REGISTRY_HOST \
     --kotsadm-namespace REGISTRY_NAMESPACE \
     --registry-username RO-USERNAME \
     --registry-password RO-PASSWORD
   ```

   Replace:

    * `APP_NAME` with a name for the application. This is the unique name that KOTS will use to refer to the application that you install.
    * `REGISTRY_HOST` with the hostname for the private registry where you pushed the admin console images.
    * `REGISTRY_NAMESPACE` with the namespace in the private registry where you pushed the images. For example, if you pushed the images to `my-registry.example.com/app-name/image:tag`, then `app-name` is the registry namespace.
    * `RO_USERNAME` and `RO_PASSWORD` with the username and password for an account that has read-only access to the private image registry.
      :::note
      KOTS stores these read-only credentials in a Kubernetes secret in the same namespace where the admin console is installed.

      KOTS uses these credentials to pull the images. To allow KOTS to pull images, the credentials are automatically created as an imagePullSecret on all of the admin console Pods.
