# Helm CLI-Only Onboarding

This topic describes how to onboard applications that will support Helm CLI installations only.

If your application will also support KOTS and Embedded Cluster installations in addition to Helm CLI installations, see [KOTS and Embedded Cluster Onboarding](distributing-workflow). 

## Before You Begin

This section includes guidance and prerequisites to review before you begin onboarding your application.

### Prerequisites

<Prerequisites/>

* <Cluster/>

### Best Practices and Recommendations

<BestPractices/>

### Getting Help from the Community

<Community/>

## Onboarding

### Task 0: Create an Application

<CreateApp/>

### Task 0: Connect Your Image Registry

<ImageRegistry/>

### Task 0: Package Your Helm Chart with the Replicated SDK

To package a Helm chart with the Replicated SDK as a dependency:

1. <PackageSdk/>

   <DependencyYaml/>   

1. Update dependencies and package the chart as a `.tgz` file:

    <HelmPackage/>

1. Add the `.tgz` file to a release. For more information, see [Managing Releases with the Vendor Portal](releases-creating-releases) or [Managing Releases with the CLI](releases-creating-cli).

### Task 0: Enable the Proxy Service

To enable the proxy service for Helm CLI installations:

<EnableProxyService/>

### Task 0: Add Preflight Checks and Support Bundles

<AboutPreflightsSupportBundles/>

#### Task 0a: Define Preflight Checks

<Preflights/>

#### Task 0b: Add the Default Support Bundle Spec

<SupportBundles/>

### Task 0: Customize Customer Licenses

Add custom license entitlements, and use the SDK API to check entitlements in the customer environment.

* Add custom entitlements
* Add entitlement checks
* License field signature validation

<a href="/vendor/licenses-reference-helm">Checking Entitlements in Helm Charts Before Deployment</a>

<p>Use the SDK API to add checks for customer license entitlements during runtime.</p>
<p>To get started, use the SDK in integration mode to develop locally without needing to make real changes in the Vendor Portal or in your environment.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated time:</strong> 1 hour to integrate pre-installation license checks into your application, plus more time to test and iterate</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/vendor/licenses-reference-sdk">Querying Entitlements with the Replicated SDK API</a></li>
<li><a href="/reference/replicated-sdk-apis">Replicated SDK API</a></li>
<li><a href="/vendor/replicated-sdk-development">Developing Against the SDK API</a></li>
</ul>  

<p>Verify the signatures of license fields when you check customer entitlements in your application.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated time:</strong> 2 hours, including time to add entitlement checks in your application if you have not already</p>

### Task 0: Add Custom Domains

<CustomDomains/>

## Next Steps

After completing the main onboarding tasks, Replicated recommends that you also complete the following additional tasks to integrate other Replicated features with your application. You can complete these next recommended tasks in any order.

### Customize the Default Support Bundle Spec

<CustomizeSupportBundles/>

### Add Custom Metrics

<CustomMetrics/>

### Integrate with CI/CD and Compatibility Matrix

<CiCd/>

### Customize Release Channels

<CustomChannels/>
