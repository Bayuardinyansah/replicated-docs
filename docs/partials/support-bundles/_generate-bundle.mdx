Support bundles are generated from one or more support bundle specifications. Specification locations include YAML manifest files in the cluster, URLs, and Secrets or ConfigMap objects embedded in a Kubernetes cluster. For more information, see [Collecting a Support Bundle](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/support-bundle/collecting/) and [Discover Cluster Specs](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/support-bundle/discover-cluster-specs/) in the Troubleshoot documentation.

The following examples show some possible CLI commands to generate a support bundle for one or more specifications and locations:

- Automatically discover specifications in the cluster that are contained in Secrets or ConfigMaps:

  ```bash
  kubectl support-bundle --load-cluster-specs
  ```
- Automatically discover specifications found in the cluster that match a custom label:

  ```bash
  kubectl support-bundle --load-cluster-specs -l LABEL
  ```

  Replace `LABEL` with the label name.

- Using one or more files:

  ```bash
  kubectl support-bundle ./PATH_TO_FILE1 ./PATH_TO_FILE2 ./PATH_TO_FILE3
  ```

  Replace `PATH_TO_FILE` with the path and YAML file name for each file.

- Using a URL and a specification in the cluster:

  ```bash
  kubectl support-bundle URL \
  ./PATH_TO_FILE 
  ```
  
  Replace:

  - `URL` with the online specification location provided by your vendor
  - `PATH_TO_FILE` with the path and YAML file name
