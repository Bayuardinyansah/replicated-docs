# About Embedded Kubernetes

This topic describes Replicated's embedded Kubernetes solutions, which allow software vendors to deliver Kubernetes alongside their application for the purpose of supporting installations on virtual machines (VMs) or bare metal servers.

## Overview

Many enterprise users of commerical software prefer to install applications on a virtual machine (VM) or bare metal server, rather than in a Kubernetes cluster. Reasons for this can include a lack of experience with Kubernetes or the relative ease of provisoning virtual or physical harware in their environment compared to managing Kubernetes.

Software vendors with Kubernetes applications can support installations on VMs or bare metal servers by embedding a Kubernetes distribution with their application. When you use Replicated to embed Kubernetes with your application, you can define a Kubernetes distribution so that a cluster that meets your application's requirements is created in the customer environment at the time of installation. This allows you to distribute your application to enterprise customers that lack an existing Kubernetes cluster without requiring those users to learn, manage, or interact directly with Kubernetes.
