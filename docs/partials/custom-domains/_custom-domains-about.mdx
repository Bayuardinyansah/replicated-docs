You can use custom domains to alias Replicated endpoints by creating Canonical Name (CNAME) records for your domains.

Replicated domains are external to your domain and can require additional security reviews by your customer. Using custom domains as aliases can bring the domains inside an existing security review and reduce your exposure.

TXT records must be created to verify:

- Domain ownership: Domain ownership is verified when you initially add a record.
- TLS certificate creation: Each new domain must have a new TLS certificate to be verified.

The TXT records can be removed after the verification is complete.
