# Configuring a Slack Webhook (Alpha)

Vendors can configure a Slack webhook to enable notifications to be sent to a shared Slack channel. The notifications provide visibility about customer instance statuses.

<NotificationsAbout/>

Notifications settings are shared, viewable, and editable by the entire team. Any changes made by a team member impacts the team.

## Limitation

Supports only one channel per team.

## Prerequisite

Create a Slack webhook URL. For more information, see [Sending Messages using Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) in the Slack API documentation.

Make sure to keep the URL secure because it contains a Secret that allows write access to one or more channels in your Slack Workspace.

## Configure the Webhook in the Vendor Portal

When you enable Slack notifications for a team, you first configure the Slack webhook in the vendor portal. Typically you do this one time. Then you can configure notifications for the customer instances.

To configure the Slack webhook:

1. From the **[Team vendor portal](https://vendor.replicated.com/team/members)** page, click **Slack Notifications**.

1. On the **Slack Notifications Setup** page, paste the Slack webhook URL. Click **Save**.

## Next Step
