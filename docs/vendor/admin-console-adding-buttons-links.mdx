# Adding Links to the Dashboard

This topic describes how to use the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource to add links to the Replicated KOTS Admin Console dashboard.

## Overview

Replicated recommends that every application include a Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource. The Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource provides a standard API for creating, viewing, and managing applications. For more information, see [Kubernetes Applications](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application#kubernetes-applications) in the kubernetes-sigs GitHub repository.

You can include the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource in your releases to add links to the Admin Console dashboard. Common use cases include adding links to documentation, dashboards, or a landing page for the application.

For example, the following shows an **Open App** button on the dashboard of the Admin Console for an application named Gitea:

:::note
KOTS uses the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource as metadata and does not require or use an in-cluster controller to handle this custom resource. An application that follows best practices does not require cluster admin privileges or any cluster-wide components to be installed.

## Add a Link

To add a link to the Admin Console dashboard, include a [Kubernetes SIG Application](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application#kubernetes-applications) custom resource in the release with a `spec.descriptor.links` field. The `spec.descriptor.links` field is an array of links that are displayed on the Admin Console dashboard after the application is deployed.

Each link in the `spec.descriptor.links` array contains two fields:
* `description`: The link text that will appear on the Admin Console dashboard.
* `url`: The target URL.

For example:

```yaml
# app.k8s.io/v1beta1 Application Custom resource

apiVersion: app.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: "gitea"
spec:
  descriptor:
    links:
      - description: About Wordpress
        url: "https://wordpress.org/"
```

When the application is deployed, the "About Wordpress" link is displayed on the Admin Console dashboard as shown below:

<img alt="About Wordpress link on the Admin Console dashboard" src="/images/dashboard-link-about-wordpress.png" width="450px"/>

For an additional example of a Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource, see [application.yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application/blob/master/docs/examples/wordpress/application.yaml) in the kubernetes-sigs GitHub repository.

### Create URLs with User-Supplied Values Using KOTS Template Functions {#url-template}

You can use KOTS template functions to template URLs in the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource. This can be useful when all or some of the URL is a user-supplied value. For example, an application might allow users to provide their own ingress controller or load balancer. In this case, the URL can be templated to render the hostname that the user provides on the Admin Console Config screen.

The following examples show how to use the KOTS [ConfigOption](/reference/template-functions-config-context#configoption) template function in the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource `spec.descriptor.links.url` field to render one or more user-supplied values:

* In the example below, the URL hostname is a user-supplied value for an ingress controller that the user configures during installation.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: app.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Application
    metadata:
      name: "my-app"
    spec:
      descriptor:
        links:
          - description: Open App
            url: 'http://{{repl ConfigOption "ingress_host" }}'
    ```
* In the example below, both the URL hostname and a node port are user-supplied values. The user might need to supply a node port if you are exposing NodePort type services for installations on VMs or bare metal servers with Replicated Embedded Cluster or kURL. 

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: app.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Application
    metadata:
      name: "my-app"
    spec:
      descriptor:
        links:
          - description: Open App
            url: 'http://{{repl ConfigOption "hostname" }}:{{repl ConfigOption "node_port"}}'
    ```        

For more information about working with KOTS template functions, see [About Template Functions](/reference/template-functions-about).

### Automatically Rewrite URLs Using KOTS {#kots-rewrite}

When providing a link to your application on the Admin Console dashboard, there are some cases where it might not be possible to construct the URL ahead of installation. For example:
* You do not want to require users to set up an ingress controller or a load balancer, or otherwise provide an IP address or hostname on the KOTS Config screen during initial installation
* The hostname or IP address in the installation environment cannot be determined
* You want to add a link to a port-forwarded service in existing cluster installations

In these cases, it is possible to use the KOTS Application custom resource `ports` key to automatically rewrite URLs provided in the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource at the time of installation. This includes automatically rewriting the URL to use the hostname in the browser where the Admin Console is being accessed and appending a local port.

For more information about configuring the `ports` key, inclduing examples, see [Port Forwarding Services with KOTS](admin-console-port-forward).

:::note
Using KOTS to automatically rewrite URLs is particularly useful when you are developing and testing KOTS releases for your application, as it provides an easier way to access the application after installation. However, for production releases, it is more common to have the user provide an IP address or hostname during installation as described in [Create URLs with User-Supplied Values Using KOTS Template Functions](#url-template).
