1. In the **New Service Account** dialog:

    1. Enter a name the token in the **Nickname** field. Names for service accounts must be unique within a given team.

    1. Select the RBAC policy from the dropdown list. The token must have `Admin` access to create new releases.

    1. (Optional) Select the **Limit to read-only version of above policy** check box to if you want use an existing RBAC policy that has Read/Write permissions but limit this service account to read-only. This option lets you maintain one version of an RBAC policy instead of two versions (one read/write version and one read-only version).

      Users with a non-admin RBAC role cannot select any other RBAC role when creating a token. They are restricted to creating a token with their same level of access to avoid permission elevation.
