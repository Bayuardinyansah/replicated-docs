The following are some best practices and recommendations for successfully onboarding with Replicated:

* When integrating new Replicated features with an application, make changes in small iterations and test frequently by installing or upgrading the application in a development environment. This will help you to more easily identify issues and troubleshoot.

* Use the Replicated CLI to create and manage your application and releases. Getting familiar with the Replicated CLI will help later on when integrating Replicated workflows into your CI/CD pipelines. For more information, see [Installing the Replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).

* Ask for help from the Replicated community. For more information, see [Get Help from the Community](#get-help-from-the-community).
