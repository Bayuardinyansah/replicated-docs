# Step 7: Deploy the Application

After you run the installation script from the previous step, the Replicated admin console is running, but the application is not yet deployed.

This procedure shows you how to deploy the application by logging into the admin console, uploading the license file that you created as part of [Step 5: Create a Customer](tutorial-cli-create-customer), completing the application configuration settings, and running the preflight checks.

To deploy the application:

1. In a browser, go to `http://localhost:8800` to access the admin console.

  :::note
  You can access the admin console as long as the installation script is running. If you press Ctrl+C to exit, run `kubectl kots admin-console --namespace cli-tutorial` to access the admin console again.
  :::

1. Enter the password that you created in [Step 6: Install the App Manager](tutorial-cli-install-app-manager) to log in to the admin console.

1. On the Upload your license file page, select the license file that you downloaded to your Desktop in [Step 5: Create a Customer](tutorial-cli-create-customer). Click **Upload license**.

    With the license file, the admin console can pull containers and run the application.

1. On the Configure App Name page, select the **Customize Text Inputs** checkbox. In the **Text Example** field, enter any text. For example, `Hello`.

   This page displays configuration settings that are specific to the application. Software vendors define the fields that are displayed on this page in the Replicated Config custom resource. For more information, see [Config](/reference/custom-resource-config) in _Reference_.

1. Click **Continue**.

   The preflight checks automatically run. Preflight checks are designed to help ensure the environment meets the minimum requirements to run the application. Software vendors define preflight checks in the Replicated Preflight custom resource. For more information, see [Preflight and Support Bundle](/reference/custom-resource-preflight) in _Reference_.

1. After the preflight checks complete, click **Continue**. If there are failing preflight checks, click **Deploy and continue** in the dialog. The admin console dashboard opens.

   On the admin console **Dashboard** tab, users can take various actions, including viewing the application status, opening the application, checking for application updates, syncing their license, and setting up application monitoring on the cluster with Prometheus.

1. Click **Open App** to view the application in your browser.

   Notice the text that you entered previously on the configuration page is displayed on the screen.

1. In your cluster, press Ctrl + C to exit the admin console. List the Pods to see the example NGINX service that you just deployed:

    ```
    kubectl get pods --namespace APP_NAMESPACE
    ```

    ```
    NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    kotsadm-7595595bf5-pmlng   1/1     Running   0          21m
    kotsadm-minio-0            1/1     Running   0          22m
    kotsadm-rqlite-0           1/1     Running   0          22m
    nginx-667f4fc76b-8gvr9     1/1     Running   0          17m
    ```
1. Run the following command to start the admin console again:

   ```
   kubectl kots admin-console --namespace cli-tutorial
   ```
## Next Step

Continue to [Step 8: Create a New Version](tutorial-cli-create-new-version) to make a change to one of the manifest files for the `cli-tutorial` application, then use the replicated CLI to create and promote a new release.
