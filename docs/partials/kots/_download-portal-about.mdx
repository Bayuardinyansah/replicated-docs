The Replicated Download Portal can be used to share license files, air gap bundles, and other assets with customers. A unique Download Portal link is available for each customer. The Download Portal uses information from the customer's license to make the relevant assets available for download, such as:
* The license file
* `.airgap` bundles for the application releases that the customer has access to based on their channel assignment
* The Replicated KOTS Admin Console `kotsadm.tar.gz` air gap bundle
* The Replicated kURL `.tgz` air gap bundle
* Preflight, support bundle, and KOTS CLI kubectl plugins
