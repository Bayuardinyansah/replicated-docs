# Step 3: Create a Customer License

A customer license, downloadable as a YAML file, is required to install any application.

To create a customer license:

1. From the vendor portal, select **Customers** from the left menu.

1. Click **Create your first customer**.

  The Create a new customer page opens.

1. Edit the following fields, leaving the rest of the fields set to the default values:

    1. Enter your name for the Customer Name field.
    1. Select the Unstable channel on the right hand side.

    1. Click **Create Customer**.

    1. Click **Download license** in the upper right corner for the newly created customer.

      This downloads the file with your customer name and a `.yaml` extension. This is the license file your customer needs to install your application. When a customer is installing your software you need to send them two things: the app manager installation script and the license file.

      You will also use this license file to install and test the application on the test server.
