  <td><code>--with-minio</code></td>
  <td>bool</td>
  <td><p>When <code>true</code>, KOTS deploys a local MinIO instance for storage and uses MinIO for host path and NFS snapshot storage.</p>
  <p>When <code>false</code>, KOTS upgrades the existing admin console instance to the latest version, replaces the running deployment with a StatefulSet, and removes MinIO after a data migration. This results in temporary downtime for the admin console, but deployed applications are unaffected. <strong>Note:</strong> Deploying KOTS without object storage includes limitations for local snapshot storage. See <a href="/enterprise/installing-stateful-component-requirements#snapshots-storage-limitations">Snapshots Storage Limitations</a> in <em>Installing Without Object Storage</em>.</p>
