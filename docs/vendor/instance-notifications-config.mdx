# Configuring Instance Notifications

<NotificationsAbout/>

Teams can receive notifications about customer insights through a Slack channel. Individual users can also receive notifications about instance statuses through email.

## Prerequisite

For Slack notifications, you must enable notifications at the Team level before you can turn on instance notifications. For more information, see [Configuring Slack Notifications](team-management-slack-config).

## Configure Notifications

Follow this procedure to configure Slack or email notifications. 

To configure notifications for an instance:

1. Go to **Applications > Customers**, and click an instance under a customer that you want to receive notifications for.

    <img src="/images/customer-instances.png" alt="Customer instances list in the vendor portal" width="600"/>

1. On the Instance Details page, click **Notifications**.

1. From the **Configure Instance Notifications** dialog, select **Slack Notifications** or use the default **My Notification** tab for email notifications.
 
    <img width="400px" src="/images/instance-notifications-dialog.png" />

1. Select one of the following options:

    - **App Changes:** Sends notifications for application health status changes.
    - **All Changes:** Sends notifications for all instance changes, including version changes and Kubernetes upgrades.
    - **None:** Turns off notifications.

1. Click **Save My Notifications**.

1. Repeat these steps for every instance that you want to receive or manage notifications for.


## Test Notifications

After you enable notifications for a running development instance, test that your notifications are working as expected.

Do this by forcing your application into a non-ready state. For example, you can delete one or more application Pods and wait for a Replication controller to recreate them.

Then look for notifications in the assigned Slack channel. You also receive an email if you enabled email notifications.

:::note
There is a 30-second buffer between event detection and notifications being sent. This buffer provides better roll-ups and reduces noise.
