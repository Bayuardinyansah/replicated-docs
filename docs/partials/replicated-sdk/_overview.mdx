The Replicated SDK is a Helm chart that can be installed as a small service alongside your application Helm chart. The Replicated SDK allows you to install your application with Helm while having access to Replicated features such as:

* Insights and telemetry for instances of your application running in customer environments 
* Customer license and entitlements enforcement before installation and at runtime 
* Preflight checks to verify that the environment meets requirements before installation 
* Update checks to alert your customers when new versions of your application are available for upgrade

To get started with the Replicated SDK, edit your application Helm chart to declare the SDK as a dependency, then promote a new release with your Helm chart to a development channel in the Replicated vendor portal.
