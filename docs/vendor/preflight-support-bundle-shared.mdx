# Defining Shared Collectors and Analyzers with Helm Templating

This topic describes how to use Helm templating to share collectors and analyzers between your preflight and support bundles specs. The information in this topic applies to preflight checks and support bundles that are defined in Kubernetes Secrets.

## Overview

Preflight checks and support bundles are both defined in YAML specs that include _collectors_ and _analyzers_. Collectors determine what information is gathered from the customer environment and analyzers then use this data to provide output to users, usually in the form of troubleshooting suggestions. For more information, see [About Preflights and Support Bundles](preflight-support-bundle-about).

<Overview/>

For more information about the `define` template functions, see [Names of Defined Templates](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/templates/#names-of-defined-templates) in the Helm documentation. For more information about the `include` template function, see [Using the 'include' Function](https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/#using-the-include-function) in the Helm documentation.

## Recommendations

Consider the following recommendations before creating shared collectors and analyzers:

* Your support bundles should include all of the same collectors and analyzers that are in your preflight checks. This ensures that support bundles include all the necessary troubleshooting information, including any failures in preflight checks.

* In addition to your shared collectors and analyzers, you will also likely need to define other collectors and analyzers that are included in support bundles only. This is because some of the information used for troubleshooting (such as logs) is not necessary when running preflight checks before installation. Conversely, you should not have any collectors and analyzers that are only included in preflight checks.

* When using the Helm `include` template function in your preflight and support bundle specs, use [`nindent`](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/function_list/#nindent) to ensure the rendered YAML has the correct spacing.

## Include Shared Collectors and Analyzers in Preflights and Support Bundles 

To include shared collectors and analyzers in preflight and support bundle specs:

1. In your Helm chart `templates` directory, define the shared collectors and analyzers that you want to include using Helm defined templates.

   **Example**:
   
   The example below creates two defined templates: `"troubleshoot.collectors.shared"` and `"troubleshoot.analyzers.shared"`.

   ```yaml
   # Defines the shared collectors
   {{- define "troubleshoot.collectors.shared" -}}
   - clusterInfo: {}
   - clusterResources: {}
   - registryImages:
       images:
         - replicated/replicated-sdk:v1.0.0-beta.11
   {{- end -}}
   
   # Defines the shared analyzers
   {{- define "troubleshoot.analyzers.shared" -}}
   - registryImages:
       name: Registry Images
       outcomes:
         - fail:
           when: "missing > 0"
           message: Images are missing from registry
         - warn:
             when: "errors > 0"
             message: Failed to check if images are present in registry
         - pass:
             message: All images are present in registry
   - clusterVersion:
       checkName: Is this cluster running a supported Kubernetes verison
       outcomes:
         - fail:
             when: "< 1.19.0"
             message: This {{ include "common.names.name" . | title }} Helm chart is only supported on Kubernetes 1.19 or later
             uri: https://www.kubernetes.io
         - warn:
             when: "< 1.24.0"
             message: |
               You can run {{ include "common.names.name" . | title }} on your current cluster version, but your cluster is no longer supported 
               by the Kubernetes community. If you have extended support available from your Kubernetes
               vendor you can ignore this warning.
             uri: https://kubernetes.io
         - pass:
             message: |
               Your current Kubernetes version is able to run {{ include "common.names.name" . | title }} using this Helm chart and is a
               version currently supported by the Kubernets community.
    {{- end -}}                    
    ```

1. In a new YAML file in the `templates` directory, create a defined template with the support bundle spec (`apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2` and `kind: SupportBundle`).

   **Example**:
    
   ```yaml
   {{- define "troubleshoot.supportBundle" -}}
   apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
   kind: SupportBundle
   metadata:
     name: {{ include "common.names.name" . }}-support-bundle
   spec:
   {{- end -}}
   ```

1. In the support bundle spec, use the Helm `include` template to include the shared collectors and analyzers that you defined. Also, add any additional collectors and analyzers that you want to include only in support bundles (and not in preflight checks).

   **Example**:
    
   ```yaml
   {{- define "troubleshoot.supportBundle" -}}
   apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
   kind: SupportBundle
   metadata:
     name: {{ include "common.names.name" . }}-support-bundle
   spec:
     # Use {{ include }} to include the shared collectors
     # Use nindent to ensure correct YAML spacing
     collectors: {{- include "troubleshoot.collectors.shared" .  | nindent 4 }}
     # Add any collectors that are only included in support bundles
       - logs:
           name: app/replicated/logs
           selectors: 
             - app.kubernetes.io/name=replicated
             - app.kubernetes.io/={{ .Release.Name }}
           limits:
             maxAge: 720h
       - logs:
           name: app/{{ include "common.names.name" . }}/logs
           selectors: {{- include "common.labels.matchLabels" . | nindent 10 }}
           limits:
             maxAge: 720h
     # Use {{ include }} to include the shared analyzers    
     analyzers: {{- include "troubleshoot.analyzers.shared" .  | nindent 4 }}
     # Add any analyzers that are only included in support bundles
       - deploymentStatus:
           name: replicated
           outcomes:
             - fail:
                 when: "absent" # Note that the "absent" failure state must be listed first if used.
                 message: The replicated deployment is not present.
             - fail:
                 when: "< 1"
                 message: The replicated deployment does not have any ready replicas.
             - warn:
                 when: "< 1"
                 message: The replicated deployment has less than the required number of replicas.
             - warn:
                 when: "= 1"
                 message: The replicated deployment has only a single ready replica.
             - pass:
                 message: There are multiple replicas of the replicated deployment ready.
   {{- end -}}
   ```

1. In a new YAML file in the `templates` directory, create a defined template with the preflight spec (`apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2` and `kind: Preflight`). In the spec, use the Helm `include` template to include the shared collectors and analyzers that you defined.

   **Example**:

   ```yaml
   {{- define "troubleshoot.preflights" -}}
   apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
   kind: Preflight
   metadata:
     name: {{ include "common.names.name" . }}-preflight
   spec:
     collectors: {{- include "troubleshoot.collectors.shared" .  | nindent 4 }}
     analyzers: {{- include "troubleshoot.analyzers.shared" .  | nindent 4 }}
   {{- end -}}
   ```

1. Finally, include the preflight and support bundle specs in Kubernetes Secrets. This allows the specs to be discovered when users run preflights and generate support bundles.

    **Example:**

    In the example below, the `"troubleshoot.preflights"` and `"troubleshoot.supportBundle"` templates are included in two different Secrets as string data. When these Secrets are templated, the collectors and analyzers defined in each spec (including the shared collectors and analyzers) are rendered.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: {{ include "common.names.name" . }}-preflight
      labels: {{- include "common.labels.standard" . | nindent 4 }}
        troubleshoot.sh/kind: preflight
    stringData:
      preflight.yaml: |- {{- include "troubleshoot.preflights" . | nindent 4 }}
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: {{ include "common.names.name" . }}-support-bundle
      labels: {{- include "common.labels.standard" . | nindent 4 }}
        troubleshoot.sh/kind: support-bundle
    stringData:
      support-bundle-spec: |- {{- include "troubleshoot.supportBundle" . | nindent 4 }}
    ```

1. Package your Helm chart to a `.tgz` chart archive and add the archive to a new release to test your changes. For more information, see [Packaging a Helm Chart for a Release](/vendor/helm-install-release).
