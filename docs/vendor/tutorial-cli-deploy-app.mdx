# Step 7: Deploy the Application

After you run the installation script from the previous step, the Replicated admin console is running, but the application is not yet deployed.

To install and deploy the application on the cluster, you log in the admin console, upload the license file, complete the application configuration settings, and run the preflight checks.

To deploy the application:

1. In a browser, go to http://localhost:8800 to access the admin console. This is the URL that was provided in the output of the installation script from [Step 6: Install the App Manager](tutorial-cli-install-app-manager).

  :::note
  You can access the admin console as long as the installation script is running. If you press Ctrl+C to exit, run `kubectl kots admin-console --namespace cli-tutorial` to access the admin console again.
  :::

1. Enter the password that you created in [Step 6: Install the App Manager](tutorial-cli-install-app-manager) to log in to the admin console.

1. On the Upload your license file page, select the license file that you downloaded to your Desktop in [Step 5: Create a Customer](tutorial-cli-create-customer). Click **Upload license**.
    With the license file, the admin console can pull containers and run the application.

1. On the Configure App Name page, select the **Customize Text Inputs** checkbox. In the **Text Example** field, enter any text. For example, `Hello`.

   The configuration page in the admin console collects user input for custom configuration settings that are specific to the application. For example, as a software vendor, you can include fields on the configuration page that allow users to provide their own database for use with your application.

1. Click **Continue**.

   The preflight checks automatically run. Preflight checks are designed to help ensure the environment meets the minimum requirements to run the application. As a software vendor, you define preflight checks in the Preflight Replicated custom resource.

1. After the preflight checks complete, click **Continue**. The admin console dashboard opens.

   :::note
   If there are failing preflight checks, click **Deploy and continue** in the dialog.
   :::

   On the admin console **Dashboard** tab, users can take various actions, including viewing the application status, opening the application, checking for application updates, syncing their license, and setting up application monitoring on the cluster with Prometheus.

1. Click **Open App** to view the application in your browser.

   Notice the text that you entered previously on the configuration page is displayed on the screen.

1. In your cluster, list the Pods to see the example NGINX service that you just deployed:

    ```
    kubectl get pods --namespace APP_NAMESPACE
    ```

    ```
    NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    kotsadm-7595595bf5-pmlng   1/1     Running   0          21m
    kotsadm-minio-0            1/1     Running   0          22m
    kotsadm-rqlite-0           1/1     Running   0          22m
    nginx-667f4fc76b-8gvr9     1/1     Running   0          17m
    ```

In the next step, you will use the replicated CLI to create and promote a new release for the application.
