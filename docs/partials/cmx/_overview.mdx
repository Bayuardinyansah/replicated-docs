The Replicated compatibility matrix quickly provisions ephemeral clusters of different Kubernetes distributions and versions, such as OpenShift, EKS, and Replicated kURL clusters. You can use the compatibility matrix to get access to customer-representative environments within minutes or less. This allows you to more easily test your application for compatability with a range of different environments before releasing to customers.

Example use cases for the compatiblity matrix include:
* Get access to a cluster to develop on and quickly test changes.
* Reproduce a reported issue on a customer-representative environment for troubleshooting.
* Run tests before releasing a new version of your application to validate compatibility with supported distributions.
