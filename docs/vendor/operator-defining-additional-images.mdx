# Defining Additional Images

This topic describes how to define additional images to be included in the `.airgap` bundle for a release.

## Overview

<AirGapBundle/>

When building the `.airgap` bundle for a release, KOTS finds and includes all images defined in the Pod specs for the release. During installation or upgrade, KOTS collects images from the `.airgap` bundle, then retags and pushes them to the registry supplied by the enterprise user.

Any required images that are _not_ defined in your application manifests must be listed in the `additionalImages` attribute of the KOTS Application custom resource. This ensures that the images are included in the `.airgap` bundle for the release.

## Define Additional Images for Air Gap Bundles

KOTS supports including the following types of images in the `additionalImages` field:

* Public images referenced by the docker pullable image name
* Images pushed to a private, linked registry referenced by the docker pullable name
* Images pushed to the Replicated registry referenced by the `registry.replicated.com` name

The following example demonstrates adding different images to `additionalImages`:

```yaml
apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  additionalImages:
    - elasticsearch:7.6.0
    - registry.replicated.com/my-operator/my-private-image:abd123f
    - quay.io/orgname/private-image:v1.2.3
```
