KOTS lets you package and update applications using Helm charts, Kubernetes manifests, or Kubernetes Operators. Applications are then securely deployed in customer environments using the KOTS installer. 

For customers that do not have an existing cluster, you can include a kURL installer to provision an embedded cluster, and then KOTS installs the application.

KOTS and kURL support installing in air gapped environments.
