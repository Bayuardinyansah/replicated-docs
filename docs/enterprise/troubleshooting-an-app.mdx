# Generating Support Bundles

The Replicated admin console includes a Troubleshoot page where you can generate an analysis and review remediation suggestions for troubleshooting an application. You can download a support bundle to share with your vendor.

Alternatively, you can generate a support bundle using the support-bundle CLI. For Kubernetes installer clusters, you can also generate a host support bundle.

## Generating a Bundle using the CLI

You can generate a support bundle using the command line (CLI) instead of the admin console. For example, the admin console might not be available if you are using a Kubernetes installer (embedded installer) and the installation fails. Or perhaps you need to use a more recent version of the support-bundle plugin than what is embedded in the admin console.

### Prerequisite: Install the Plugin {#plugin}
