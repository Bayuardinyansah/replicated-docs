# Step 9: Update the Application

To test the new release that you promoted, return to the Replicated admin console in a browser to update the application.

To update the application:

1. In a browser, open the admin console at `https://localhost:8800`.

   :::note
   You can access the admin console as long as the installation script is running. If you press Ctrl+C to exit, run `kubectl kots admin-console --namespace cli-tutorial` to access the admin console again.
   :::

1. Go to the Version history page, and click **Check for update**.

   The admin console loads the new release that you promoted.

1. Click **Deploy**. In the dialog, click **Yes, deploy** to deploy the new version.

1. After the admin console deploys the new version, go to the **Config** page where you can see the **Another Text Example** field that you added.

1. In the new **Another Text Example** field, enter any text. Click **Save config**.

   The admin console notifies you that the configuration settings for the application have changed.

1. In the dialog, click **Go to updated version**.

   The admin console loads the updated version on the Version history page.

1. On the Version history page, click **Deploy** next to the latest version to deploy the configuration change.

1. After the admin console deploys the configuration change, go to the **Dashboard** page and click **Open App**.

   The application displays the text that you added to the field.

   :::note
   If you do not see the new text, click Refresh in your browser.
