* If you are relatively new to Kubernetes or Helm, start with a basic tutorial. For example, see [10 Helm Tutorials to Start your Kubernetes Journey](https://jfrog.com/blog/10-helm-tutorials-to-start-your-kubernetes-journey/) or [Tutorials](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

* When integrating new Replicated features with an application, make changes in small iterations and test frequently by installing or upgrading the application in a development environment. This will help you to more easily identify issues and troubleshoot.

* Try creating and managing releases with both the vendor portal and the replicated CLI. For more information, see [Installing the replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).

* Ask for help from the Replicated community. For more information, see [Get Help from the Community](#get-help-from-the-community).
