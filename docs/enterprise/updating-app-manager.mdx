# Performing Updates in Existing Clusters

This topic describes how to update applications and Replicated KOTS in existing cluster installations.

## Update an Application Using the Admin Console

You can perform an application update using the KOTS Admin Console or the KOTS CLI. You can also set up automatic updates. See [Configuring Automatic Updates](/enterprise/updating-apps).

### Online Environments

<AdminConsole/>

### Air Gap Environments

## Update an Application Using the KOTS CLI

### Online Environments

To update an application in online environments:

```bash
kubectl kots upstream upgrade APP_SLUG -n ADMIN_CONSOLE_NAMESPACE
```

:::note
Adding the `--deploy` flag will also automatically deploy the latest version.
:::

### Air Gap Environments

To update an application in air gap environments:

1. Get the new `.airgap` bundle for the target application release and ensure that it is available on your local machine.

1. Run the following command to update the application:

    ```bash
    kubectl kots upstream upgrade APP_SLUG \
      --airgap-bundle NEW_AIRGAP_BUNDLE \
      --kotsadm-registry REGISTRY_HOST[/REGISTRY_NAMESPACE] \
      --registry-username USERNAME \
      --registry-password PASSWORD \
      -n ADMIN_CONSOLE_NAMESPACE
    ```
    Where:
    * `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug for the application. See [Get the Application Slug](/vendor/vendor-portal-manage-app#slug) in _Managing Applications_.
    * `NEW_AIRGAP_BUNDLE` is the `.airgap` bundle for the target release.
    * `REGISTRY_HOST` is the hostname for the registry where 
    * `REGISTRY_NAMESPACE` is an optional field 
    * `USERNAME`
    * `PASSWORD`

:::note
Adding the `--deploy` flag will also automatically deploy this version.
:::

## Update KOTS

This section describes how to update the version of Replicated KOTS running in your cluster. For information about the latest versions of KOTS, see [KOTS Release Notes](/release-notes/rn-app-manager).

:::note
Downgrading KOTS to a version earlier than what is currently deployed is not supported.
:::

### Online Environments

To update KOTS in an online existing cluster:

1. (Optional) If you already have the KOTS CLI installed, run `kubectl kots version` to see the currently installed version.

1. Run _one_ of the following commands to install or update the KOTS CLI:

    - **Install or update to the latest version**:

      ```
      curl https://kots.io/install | bash
      ```

    - **Install or update to a specific version**:

      ```
      curl https://kots.io/install/VERSION | bash
      ```
      Where `VERSION` is the target KOTS version.

    For more KOTS CLI installation options, including information about how to install or update without root access, see [Installing the KOTS CLI](/reference/kots-cli-getting-started).

1. Run the following command to update KOTS to the same version as the KOTS CLI:

   ```bash
   kubectl kots admin-console upgrade -n NAMESPACE
   ```
   Replace `NAMESPACE` with the namespace in your cluster where KOTS is installed.

   For help information, run `kubectl kots admin-console upgrade -h`.

### Air Gap Environments

For air gap installations, you first download the air gap bundle for the target version of KOTS and push the images from the air gap bundle to a private image registry.

To update KOTS in an existing air gap cluster:

1. Download the target version of the KOTS air gap bundle from [Github](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots/releases) or from the customer download page provided by your vendor. The air gap bundle is named `kotsadm.tar.gz`.

1. Install or update the KOTS CLI to the _same_ version of the air gap bundle:

   ```
   curl https://kots.io/install/VERSION | bash
   ```
   Replace `VERSION` with the same version of KOTS that is in the air gap bundle that you downloaded.

   For more KOTS CLI installation options, including information about how to install or update without root access, see [Installing the KOTS CLI](/reference/kots-cli-getting-started).

1. Push the KOTS images from the air gap bundle to a private registry:

    ```
    kubectl kots admin-console push-images ./kotsadm.tar.gz PRIVATE_REGISTRY_HOST \
      --registry-username RW_USERNAME \
      --registry-password RW_PASSWORD
    ```
    Replace:
    * `PRIVATE_REGISTRY_HOST` with the hostname for the private registry. For example, `private.registry.host/app-name`.
    * `RW_USERNAME` with the username for credentials with read and write permissions to the registry.
    * `RW_PASSWORD` with the password associated with the username. 

1. Run the following command using registry read-only credentials to update KOTS:

    ```
    kubectl kots admin-console upgrade \
      --kotsadm-registry PRIVATE_REGISTRY_HOST \
      --registry-username RO_USERNAME \
      --registry-password RO_PASSWORD \
      -n NAMESPACE
    ```
    Replace:
    * `PRIVATE_REGISTRY_HOST` with the same private registry from the previous step. For example, `private.registry.host/app-name`.
    * `RO_USERNAME` with the username for credentials with read-only permissions to the registry.
    * `RO_PASSWORD` with the password associated with the username.
    * `NAMESPACE` with the namespace on your cluster where KOTS is installed.

    For help information, run `kubectl kots admin-console upgrade -h`.
