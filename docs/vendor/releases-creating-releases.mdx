# Creating Releases with the Vendor Portal

This topic describes how to use the Replicated vendor portal to create and promote versions of your application, edit releases, edit release properties, and archive releases.

## Create a Release

You can use standard manifest files or Helm charts to create a release. 

If you are using Helm charts, make sure that you first create the Helm chart package. For more information, see [Creating a Helm Chart Package](helm-release-creating-package).

To create and promote a release in the vendor portal:

1. From the **Applications** dropdown list, select **Create an app** or select an existing application to update.

1. Click **Releases > Create release**.

1. Drag and drop your application files to the file directory in the YAML editor.

  You can click the plus icon to add a new, untitled YAML file.

1. Edit the YAML files as needed, and click **Save release**. This saves a draft that you can continue to edit until you promote it.
   
1. Click **Promote**. In the Promote Release dialog that opens, edit the fields:

   <PromoteReleaseUi/>

1. Click **Promote**.

  The release appears in an **Active** state on the Releases page.

## Edit a Draft Release

To edit a draft release:

1. Select an existing application to update.
1. On **Releases** page, find the draft release you want to edit and click **Edit YAML**.
1. Click **Save** to save your updated draft.
1. (Optional) Click **Promote**.
  
## Edit Release Properties

1. Go to **Channels**.
1. In the channel card you want to edit, click **Release History**.
1. For the release sequence that you want to edit, click **Edit Release**.
1. Edit the properties as needed.

1. Click **Update Release**.

## Archiving Releases

You can archive releases to remove them from view on the Releases page. 

Archiving a release that has been promoted does not remove the release from the channel's Release History page or prevent the app manager from downloading the archived release.

To archive one or more releases:

1. From the Releases page, click the trash can icon in the upper right corner.
1. Select one or more releases.
1. Click **Archive Releases**.
1. Confirm the archive action when prompted. Alternatively, click **Cancel** to cancel the archiving action.
