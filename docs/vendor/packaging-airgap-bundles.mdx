# Packaging Air Gap Bundles for Helm Charts

This topic describes how to package and build air gap bundles for releases that contain one or more Helm charts. This topic applies to applications deployed with Replicated KOTS.

## Overview

<AirGapBundle/>

When building the `.airgap` bundle for a release that contains one or more Helm charts, KOTS templates the Helm charts in the release using values supplied in the KOTS HelmChart custom resource [`builder`](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart-v2#builder) key.

## Configure the `builder` Key

To build an `.airgap` bundle for a release that contains one or more Helm charts, you must configure the [`builder`](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart-v2#builder) key in the KOTS HelmChart custom resource for each Helm chart in the release.

<BuilderAirgapIntro/>

The values in the `builder` key map to values in the given Helm chart's `values.yaml` file. For example, `spec.builder.postres.enabled` in the example HelmChart custom resource below would map to a `postgres.enabled` field in the `values.yaml` file for the `samplechart` chart:

```yaml
# KOTS HelmChart custom resource

apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta2
kind: HelmChart
metadata:
  name: samplechart
spec:
  chart:
    name: samplechart
    chartVersion: 3.1.7
  builder:
    postgres:
      enabled: true 
```

For requirements, recommendations, and examples of common use cases for the `builder` key, see the sections below.

### Requirements and Recommendations

<HelmBuilderRequirements/>

### Example: Set the Image Registry for Air Gap Installations

For air gap installations, it is often required to change the default image registry where certain images are pulled. You can use the `builder` key to do this by hardcoding the target values for the image registry, repository, and tag for air gap installations, as shown in the example below:

```yaml
apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta2
kind: HelmChart
metadata:
  name: samplechart
spec:
  chart:
    name: samplechart
    chartVersion: 3.1.7
  builder:
    my-service:
      image:
        registry: index.docker.io
        repository: my-app
        tag: "1.0.2"    
```
When building the `.airgap` bundle for the release, KOTS uses the registry, repository, and tag values supplied in the `builder` key to template the Helm chart, rather than the default values defined in the Helm `values.yaml` file. This ensures that the correct image registry details are used for air gap installations, without needing to make any changes to the Helm chart directly.

### Example: Include Conditional Resources

Many applications have resources that are included or excluded from a deployment based on a given condition. For example, enterprise users might have the option to deploy an embedded database with the application or bringing their own database. To support this use case for air gap installations, the conditional resource must always be included in the air gap bundle.
