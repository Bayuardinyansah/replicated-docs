Before you can create your first release with Replicated, make sure that the following requirements are met:

- Install the replicated CLI and create an API token. See [Installing the replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).

- Create a new application using the `replicated app create APP_NAME` command. You only need to do this procedure once for each application that you want to deploy. See [`app create`](/reference/replicated-cli-app-create) in _Reference_.
