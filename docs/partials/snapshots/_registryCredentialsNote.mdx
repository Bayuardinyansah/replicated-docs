:::note
It is typical for the velero and node-agent (restic) Pods to be in the `ErrImagePull` or `ImagePullBackOff` state after you run the `velero install` command because Velero does not support passing registry credentials during installation. In the app manager v1.94.0 and later, this situation resolves itself after you complete the instructions to configure the storage destination.

To resolve this situation in app manager versions earlier than 1.94, you must patch the Velero deployment manually and add the image pull secret to access the registry.
