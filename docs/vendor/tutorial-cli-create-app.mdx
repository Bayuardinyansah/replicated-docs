# Step 2: Create an Application and API Token

To create an API token and an application:

1. Run `replicated release ls` to see an error message about a missing API token:

  ```
  Error: set up APIs: Please provide your API token
  ```

1. To authenticate and begin using the replicated CLI, create an API token in your vendor portal account:

  1. In the vendor portal, go to the [Account settings](https://vendor.replicated.com/account-settings) page.

  1. Under User API Tokens, click **New User API Token**. For Nickname, provide a name for the token. For Permissions, select **Read and Write**.

     For more information about User API tokens, see [User Tokens](/reference/replicated-cli-tokens#user-tokens) in _Using Vendor API Tokens_.

  1. Click **Create Token**.

  1. Copy the string that appears in the dialog.

1. Export the user token string that you copied in the previous step to an environment variable named `REPLICATED_API_TOKEN`:

   ```
   export REPLICATED_API_TOKEN=1234567...
   ```

1. Run the following command to verify the User API token:

   ```
   replicated release ls
   ```

   This command outputs the following error message:

   ```
   Error: App not found:
   ```

1. Run the following command to create an application:

    ```
    replicated app create cli-tutorial
    ```

    **Example ouput**:

    ```
    ID          NAME              SLUG            SCHEDULER
    2GmY...     cli-tutorial      cli-tutorial    kots
    ```

1. Run the following command to export the application slug in the output of the `app create` command as an environment variable:

  ```
  export REPLICATED_APP=cli-tutorial
  ```

1. Run the following command to verify that the `REPLICATED_API_TOKEN` and `REPLICATED_APP` environment variables are set correctly:

  ```
  replicated release ls
  ```

  In the ouput of this command, you now see an empty list of releases:

  ```
  SEQUENCE    CREATED    EDITED    ACTIVE_CHANNELS
  ```

  Later in this tutorial, you create a release from a set of sample manifest files.
