# Updating Embedded Clusters

When you update an application installed with Embedded Cluster, you update both the application and the cluster together. There is no need or mechanism to update the cluster on its own.

You can check for available application updates in the Admin Console, or use automatic updates, to retrieve newly available versions. When you deploy a new version, any changes to your application are deployed first. The Admin Console waits until your application is ready, as indicated by status informers, before making any changes to the cluster.

Any changes made to the Embedded Cluster config, including changes to the Embedded Cluster version, Helm extensions, and unsupported overrides, trigger a cluster update.

During cluster updates, the Admin Console can experience downtime and become unavailable if the Kubernetes version is updated. If youâ€™re already viewing the Admin Console when the downtime occurs, you will see a message informing you that a cluster update is in progress and that the connection will resume once the Admin Console is available again:

Do not downgrade the Embedded Cluster version. This is not supported but is not prohibited, and it can lead to unexpected behavior.
