# Generating Support Bundles

This topic describes how to generate support bundles. It includes procedures for Helm CLI installations and Replicated KOTS installations.

## Generate a Bundle Using the CLI

A support bundle can be generated with the support-bundle CLI in Helm CLI or KOTS installations.

### Prerequisite: Install the support-bundle Plugin

<InstallPlugin/>

### Generate a Bundle from a Custom Spec

<GenerateBundle/>

### Generate a Bundle from the Default Spec for Helm Installations

If a Helm installation fails and you want to collect a support bundle to assist with diagnostics, you can use a default spec to generate the bundle. This is useful if the application does not have a support bundle spec included.

To generate a support bundle from the default spec for Helm installations, the following command:

```
kubectl support-bundle https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot-specs/main/in-cluster/default.yaml
```

### Generate a Bundle from the Default Spec for KOTS (KOTS Only)

Replicated provides a default support bundle spec for KOTS that you can use to generate support bundles when an installation fails or when the application does not include a spec.

<GenerateBundleDefaultKots/>

### Generate a Bundle for Embedded Cluster (KOTS Only)

<EmbeddedClusterSupportBundle/>

### Generate a Host Bundle for kURL (KOTS Only)

Host support bundles can be used to collect information directly from the host where a kURL cluster is running, such as CPU, memory, available block devices, and the operating system.

## Generate a Bundle from the Admin Console (KOTS Only)
