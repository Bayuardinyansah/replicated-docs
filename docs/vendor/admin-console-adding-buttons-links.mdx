# Adding Links to the Dashboard

This topic describes how to use the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource to add links to the Replicated KOTS Admin Console dashboard.

## Overview

Replicated recommends that every application include a Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource. The Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource provides a standard API for creating, viewing, and managing applications. For more information, see [Kubernetes Applications](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application#kubernetes-applications) in the kubernetes-sigs GitHub repository.

You can include the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource in your releases to add links to the Admin Console dashboard. Common use cases include adding links to documentation, dashboards, or a landing page for the application.

For example, the following shows an **Open App** button on the dashboard of the Admin Console for an application named Gitea:

:::note
KOTS uses the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource as metadata and does not require or use an in-cluster controller to handle this custom resource. An application that follows best practices does not require cluster admin privileges or any cluster-wide components to be installed.

## Add a Link

To add a link to the Admin Console dashboard, include a [Kubernetes SIG Application](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application#kubernetes-applications) custom resource in the release with a `spec.descriptor.links` field. The `spec.descriptor.links` field is an array of links that are displayed on the Admin Console dashboard after the application is deployed.

Each link in the `spec.descriptor.links` array contains two fields:
* `description`: The link text that will appear on the Admin Console dashboard.
* `url`: The target URL.

For example:

```yaml
# app.k8s.io/v1beta1 Application Custom resource

apiVersion: app.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: "gitea"
spec:
  descriptor:
    links:
      - description: About Wordpress
        url: "https://wordpress.org/"
```

When the application is deployed, the "About Wordpress" link is displayed on the Admin Console dashboard as shown below:

<img alt="About Wordpress link on the Admin Console dashboard" src="/images/dashboard-link-about-wordpress.png" width="450px"/>

For an additional example of a Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource, see [application.yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application/blob/master/docs/examples/wordpress/application.yaml) in the kubernetes-sigs GitHub repository.

### KOTS Template Functions in URLs

You can use KOTS template functions to template URLs in the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource. This can be useful when all or some of the URL is a user-supplied value.

For example, an application might allow users to provide their own Ingress object. In this case, the URL can be templated to render the hostname for the Ingress object that the user supplies on the Admin Console config screen.

The following example shows how to use the KOTS [ConfigOption](/reference/template-functions-config-context#configoption) template function in the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource `spec.descriptor.links.url` field to render a user-supplied hostname in the URL:

```yaml
apiVersion: app.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: "my-app"
spec:
  descriptor:
    links:
      - description: Open App
        url: 'http://{{repl ConfigOption "ingress_host" }}'
```

For more information about working with KOTS template functions, see [About Template Functions](/reference/template-functions-about).

## Add Links to Application Services Using KOTS `ports`

This section desribes how to configure the `ports` key in the KOTS Application custom resource to add a link to a service on the Admin Console dashboard.

### Overview

The KOTS Application custom resource [`ports`](/reference/custom-resource-application#ports) key allows you to expose services to users after an application is installed before cluster ingress is configured:
* For existing cluster installations, configuring the `ports` key allows you to expose services through the KOTS port forward tunnel. For more information, see [Port Forwarding Services with KOTS](/vendor/admin-console-port-forward).
* For installations on VMs or bare metal servers with Replicated kURL or Replicated Embedded Cluster, configuring the `ports` key allows you to expose additional ports on the node to make NodePort services accessible to users. For more information, see [Exposing Services Using NodePorts](/vendor/kurl-nodeport-services).

For services added to the `ports` key, you can also add a link to the service on the Admin Console dashboard. This requires that you add a URL to the `ports.applicationURL` field in the KOTS Application custom resource and the `spec.descriptor.links.url` field in the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource.

During deployment, KOTS automatically rewrites this URL with the hostname in the browser (the hostname where the Admin Console is accessed) and appends the specified port using the following process:
1. First, KOTS checks if the `spec.ports.applicationURL` field in the KOTS Application custom resource matches the `spec.descriptor.links.url` field in the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource.
1. If the URLs match, then KOTS rewrites the URL to `http://localhost:{localPort}`, adding the local port provided for the service in the `ports` key.
1. Finally, KOTS rewrites `localhost` to the hostname in the browser where the Admin Console is accessed. For example, if the Admin Console is accessed at `gitea-admin.example.com:8800`, then the URL is rewritten to `http://gitea-admin.example.com:{localPort}`.


### Prerequisite

For installations on VMs or bare metal servers with Replicated kURL or Replicated Embedded Cluster, a NodePort type service is required. For more information, see [Exposing Services Using NodePorts](/vendor/kurl-nodeport-services).
