# Step 6: Install the App Manager

After you create and download a customer license, get the installation commands so that you can test the installation on a development server.
In this case, we demonstrate an installation without an existing cluster, on a single virtual machine (VM). This type of installation is known as an embedded or Kubernetes installer-created cluster.

To install the app manager:

1. Run the following command to get the installation commands for the Unstable channel, where you promoted the release:

    ```
    replicated channel inspect Unstable
    ```

    **Example output:**

    ```
    ID:             2GmYFUFzj8JOSLYw0jAKKJKFua8
    NAME:           Unstable
    DESCRIPTION:
    RELEASE:        1
    VERSION:        Unstable-d4173a4
    EXISTING:

        curl -fsSL https://kots.io/install | bash
        kubectl kots install cli-tutorial/unstable

    EMBEDDED:

        curl -fsSL https://k8s.kurl.sh/cli-tutorial-unstable | sudo bash

    AIRGAP:

        curl -fSL -o cli-tutorial-unstable.tar.gz https://k8s.kurl.sh/bundle/cli-tutorial-unstable.tar.gz
        # ... scp or sneakernet cli-tutorial-unstable.tar.gz to airgapped machine, then
        tar xvf cli-tutorial-unstable.tar.gz
        sudo bash ./install.sh airgap
    ```

    The output generates commands for installing on an existing Kubernetes cluster, an embedded cluster, and an air gap cluster.

1. Use SSH to access the VM that you created as part of [Set Up the Environment](tutorial-cli-setup#set-up-the-environment).

1. On the VM, run the installation script from above, using the `EMBEDDED` version:

  ```
  curl -fsSL https://k8s.kurl.sh/cli-tutorial-unstable | sudo bash
  ```

  This script installs Docker, Kubernetes, and the Replicated admin console containers (kotsadm).

  Installation takes approximately 5-10 minutes.

  After the script completes the installation, the output displays the connection URL and password for the Replicated admin console and for Grafana.

1. Copy the output of the installation script to save the login information for the admin console and the Grafana instance.

1. Reload your shell to access the cluster with kubectl:

   ```
   bash -l
   ```

1. Run the following kubectl command to view the Pods in the cluster:

    ```
    kubectl get pods
    ```
    **Example output:**

    ```
    NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    kotsadm-759486cc77-hcp8r             1/1     Running   0          15m
    kotsadm-rqlite-0                     1/1     Running   0          15m
    kurl-proxy-kotsadm-697fc4bff-ccjhz   1/1     Running   0          15m
    ```
