You cannot migrate existing Helm charts in existing installations from the Replicated Helm installation method (HelmChart custom resource with `apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1` and `useHelmInstall: false`) to a different installation method. If KOTS already installed the Helm chart previously in a customer environment with the Replicated Helm method, then KOTS does not attempt the install the chart using a different method and displays the following error message: `Deployment method for chart <chart_name> has changed`.
