Helm Kubernetes functions such as `lookup` and some `Capabilities` values are not supported with the native Helm and Replicated Helm deployment methods.

   This is because Replicated KOTS uses the `helm template` command to render chart templates locally. During rendering, Helm does not have access to the cluster where the chart will be installed. For more information, see [Kubernetes and Chart Functions](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/function_list/#kubernetes-and-chart-functions) in the Helm documentation.
