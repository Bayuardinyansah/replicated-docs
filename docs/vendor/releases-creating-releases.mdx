1. Drag and drop your application files to the file directory in the YAML editor.

  You can click the plus icon to add a new, untitled YAML file.

1. Edit the YAML files as needed, and click **Save release**. This saves a draft that you can continue to edit until you promote it.
   
1. Click **Promote**. In the Promote Release dialog that opens, edit the fields:

   <PromoteReleaseUi/>

1. Click **Promote**.

  The release appears in an **Active** state on the Releases page.

## Edit a Draft Release

To edit a draft release:

1. Select an existing application to update.
1. On **Releases** page, find the draft release you want to edit and click **Edit YAML**.
1. Click **Save** to save your updated draft.
1. (Optional) Click **Promote**.
  
## Edit Release Properties

1. Go to **Channels**.
1. In the channel card you want to edit, click **Release History**.
1. For the release sequence that you want to edit, click **Edit Release**.
1. Edit the properties as needed.

1. Click **Update Release**.

## Archiving Releases

You can archive releases to remove them from view on the Releases page. 

Archiving a release that has been promoted does not remove the release from the channel's Release History page or prevent the app manager from downloading the archived release.

To archive one or more releases:

1. From the Releases page, click the trash can icon in the upper right corner.
1. Select one or more releases.
1. Click **Archive Releases**.
1. Confirm the archive action when prompted. Alternatively, click **Cancel** to cancel the archiving action.

## Next Steps

The following are the recommended next steps to test the application in your development environment:

- To add a customer, see [Creating a Customer](releases-creating-customer).
- If you are installing for the first time, see [Overview of Installing an Application with the App Manager](/enterprise/installing-overview) in the _Enterprise_ section. 
- If you are updating an existing installation, see [Updating an Application](/enterprise/updating-apps) in the _Enterprise_ section.
