# Step 7: Reset the Node

Finally, remove the installation from your VM by resetting the node.

To reset the node:

1. Run the following command to reset the node:

   ```bash
   sudo ./$REPLICATED_APP reset
   ```

   This will remove this node from the cluster and completely reset it, removing all data stored on the node.
Do not reset another node until this is complete.

1. When prompted, enter `y`.

1. (Recommended) Reboot to ensure transient configuration is also reset.
