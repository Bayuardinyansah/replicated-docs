# Onboarding Checklist

This topic provides a checklist of key Replicated features to integrate with your application to fully onboard onto the Replicated platform. It also includes best practices and recommendations to consider while onboarding.

## Onboarding Best Practices and Recommendations

The following are Replicated's best practices and recommendations for successfully onboarding:

* If you are relatively new to Kubernetes or Helm, start with a basic tutorial. For example, see [10 Helm Tutorials to Start your Kubernetes Journey](https://jfrog.com/blog/10-helm-tutorials-to-start-your-kubernetes-journey/) or [Tutorials](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

* When integrating new Replicated features with an application, make changes in small iterations and test frequently by installing or upgrading the application in a development environment. This will help you to more easily identify issues and troubleshoot.

* Try creating and managing releases with both the vendor portal and the replicated CLI. For more information, see [Installing the replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).

* Ask for help from the Replicated community. For more information, see [Get Help from the Community](#get-help-from-the-community) below.

* Replicated also offers labs in Instruqt that provide a hands-on introduction to working with Replicated features, without needing your own sample application or development environment. To complete one or more labs before you begin the onboarding workflow, see:
  * [Distributing Your Application with Replicated](https://play.instruqt.com/embed/replicated/tracks/distributing-with-replicated?token=em_VHOEfNnBgU3auAnN): Learn how to quickly get value from the Replicated platform for your application.
  * [Avoiding Installation Pitfalls](https://play.instruqt.com/embed/replicated/tracks/avoiding-installation-pitfalls?token=em_gJjtIzzTTtdd5RFG): Learn how to use preflight checks to avoid common installation issues and assure your customer is installing into a supported environment.
  * [Closing the Support Information Gap](https://play.instruqt.com/embed/replicated/tracks/closing-information-gap?token=em_MO2XXCz3bAgwtEca): Learn how to use support bundles to close the information gap between your customers and your support team.

## Feature Checklist

The table below provides a checklist of key Replicated features to integrate with your application in order to onboard onto the Replicated platform. It also includes a link to information about how to configure the Replicated KOTS installer for vendors that will support KOTS installations for their application.

:::note
This checklist lists features in a suggested order, though you can configure and test features in any order that you prefer.
