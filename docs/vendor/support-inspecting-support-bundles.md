# Analyzing and Inspecting Support Bundles

You can use the vendor portal to get a visual analysis of customer support bundles and use the file inspector to drill down into the details and logs files. Use this information to get insights and help troubleshoot your customer issues.

To inspect a support bundle:

1. From the vendor portal, select **Troubleshoot > Upload a support bundle**.
1. In the Analyze a support bundle dialog, drag and drop or use the file selector to upload a support bundle file to the vendor portal.
1. Click **Upload support bundle**.
  The Support bundle analysis page opens and displays the analysis results.
1. (Optional) Click **Only show errors and warnings** on the Analysis overview tab to see only errors and warnings
1. On the File inspector tab, select any files from the directory tree to inspect the details of any files included in the support bundle, such as log files.
1. If you cannot resolve your customer's issue and need to submit a support request, click **Support > Submit a Support Request** or go directly to the [Support page](https://vendor.replicated.com/support). For more information, see [Submit a Support Request](support-submit-request).
