- If you are installing in high availability (HA) mode, a load balancer is required. You can use the kURL internal load balancer or bring an external load balancer. An external load balancer might be preferred when clients outside the cluster need access to the cluster's Kubernetes API.

  To install in HA mode, complete the following prerequisites:
  - (Optional) If you are going to use the kURL internal load balancer, you can preconfigure it by passing `| sudo bash -s ha ekco-enable-internal-load-balancer`.
  - To use an external load balancer, ensure that the load balancer meets the following requirements:
    - Must be a TCP forwarding load balancer
    - Must be configured to distribute traffic to all healthy control plane nodes in its target list
    - The health check must be a TCP check on port 6443
    
    For more information about how to create a load balancer for kube-apirserver, see [Create load balancer for kube-apiserver](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/high-availability/#create-load-balancer-for-kube-apiserver) in the Kubernetes documentation.
  
    You can optionally preconfigure the external loader by passing the `load-balancer-address=HOST:PORT` flag with the kURL install command. Otherwise, you are prompted to provide the load balancer address after running the install command.
