# Introduction to kURL

This topic provides an introduction to the Replicated kURL installer.

## Overview

kURL is an open source project maintained by Replicated that software vendors can use to create custom Kubernetes distributions.

This means that you can distribute your Kubernetes application to customers who do not have access to a Kubernetes cluster in their environment.

For more information about the kURL open source project, see the [kURL documentation](https://kurl.sh).

## About Defining kURL Installer Specs

To provision a cluster, kURL uses a spec defined in a manifest file with `apiVersion: cluster.kurl.sh/v1beta1` and `kind: Installer`. Software vendors can add kURL add-ons to an Installer spec to create a custom Kubernetes distribution based on their application requirements. kURL add-ons include services for networking, storage, ingress, and more. kURL also includes a KOTS add-on, which installs KOTS in the cluster and deploys the KOTS admin console.

You can create Installer specs using the Replicated vendor portal [Kubernetes installers](https://vendor.replicated.com/kurl) page. To distribute the Installer alongside your application, promote the spec to the same channel as the target application release. All releases from that channel will use the currently promoted installer.

## About Embedded Cluster Installations with KOTS and kURL

kURL has a built-in integration with KOTS through the KOTS add-on. When the KOTS add-on is included in a kURL Installer spec, customers can run the kURL installation script in their environment to provision an embedded cluster and automatically deploy the KOTS admin console to the cluster.

For information about how to install applications in embedded clusters with KOTS and kURL, see Installing with kURL.
