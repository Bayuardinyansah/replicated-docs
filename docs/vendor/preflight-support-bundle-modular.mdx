# Defining Shared Collectors and Analyzers with Helm Templating

This topic describes how to use Helm templating to share collectors and analyzers between your preflight and support bundles specs. The information in this topic applies to preflight checks and support bundles that are defined in Kubernetes Secrets.

## Overview

Preflight checks and support bundles are both defined in YAML specs that include _collectors_ and _analyzers_. Collectors determine what information is gathered from the customer environment and analyzers then use this data to provide output to users, usually in the form of troubleshooting suggestions. For more information, see [About Preflights and Support Bundles](preflight-support-bundle-about).

An applicationâ€™s preflight and support bundle specs will share many of the same collectors and analyzers. To avoid having to copy and paste collectors and analyzers between both specs, you can instead use Helm templating to define and include shared collectors and analyzers.

Shared collectors and analyzers can be defined using Helm _defined templates_, which are globally-accessible templates inside a `{{ define }}` directive. These defined templates can then be included in your preflight and support bundle specs using the Helm `include` template function. 

For more information about the `define` template functions, see [Names of Defined Templates](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/templates/#names-of-defined-templates) in the Helm documentation. For more information about the `include` template function, see [Using the 'include' Function](https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/#using-the-include-function) in the Helm documentation.

## Recommendations

Consider the following recommendations for creating shared collectors and analyzers:

* Your support bundles should include all of the same collectors and analyzers that are in your preflight checks. You will also likely define additional collectors and analyzers that are included in support bundles only. It is unlikely that you will have any collectors and analyzers that are included in preflight checks only.

* Always include the `clusterInfo` and `clusterResources` collectors as shared collectors.

* Use the [`nindent`](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/function_list/#nindent) function with the Helm `include` function to ensure the rendered YAML has the correct spacing.

* the following in your Helm `templates` directory:
  * Helm `define` templates that define the shared collectors and analyzers
  * A Helm `define` template with the support bundle spec that includes the shared collectors and analyzers, as well as any collectors and analyzers that should be included in support bundles only
  * A Helm `define` template with the preflight spec that includes the shared collectors and analyzers, as well as any collectors and analyzers that should be included in preflight checks only
  * A Kubernetes Secret that pulls in the support bundle spec
  * A Kubernetes Secret that pulls in the preflight spec

## Include Shared Collectors and Analyzers in Preflights and Support Bundles 

This procedure demonstrates how to use the Helm `define` and `include` template functions to include shared collectors and analyzers in preflight and support bundle specs.

To create preflight and support bundle specs that include shared collectors and analyzers:

1. In your Helm chart templates directory, define the shared collectors and analyzers using Helm defined templates.

   **Example**:
   
   The example below creates two defined templates: `troubleshoot.collectors.shared` and `troubleshoot.analyzers.shared`.

   ```yaml
   {{- define "troubleshoot.collectors.shared" -}}
   - clusterInfo: {}
   - clusterResources: {}
   - registryImages:
       images:
         - replicated/replicated-sdk:v1.0.0-beta.11
   {{- end -}}

   {{- define "troubleshoot.analyzers.shared" -}}
   - registryImages:
       name: Registry Images
       outcomes:
         - fail:
           when: "missing > 0"
           message: Images are missing from registry
         - warn:
             when: "errors > 0"
             message: Failed to check if images are present in registry
         - pass:
             message: All images are present in registry
   - clusterVersion:
       checkName: Is this cluster running a supported Kubernetes verison
       outcomes:
         - fail:
             when: "< 1.19.0"
             message: This {{ include "common.names.name" . | title }} Helm chart is only supported on Kubernetes 1.19 or later
             uri: https://www.kubernetes.io
         - warn:
             when: "< 1.24.0"
             message: |
               You can run {{ include "common.names.name" . | title }} on your current cluster version, but your cluster is no longer supported 
               by the Kubernetes community. If you have extended support available from your Kubernetes
               vendor you can ignore this warning.
             uri: https://kubernetes.io
         - pass:
             message: |
               Your current Kubernetes version is able to run {{ include "common.names.name" . | title }} using this Helm chart and is a
               version currently supported by the Kubernets community.
    {{- end -}}                    
    ```

1. In a new YAML file, create another defined template with the support bundle spec (`apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2` and `kind: SupportBundle`).

   In the support bundle spec, do the following:

    * Use the Helm `include` template to include the shared collectors and analyzers that you defined.
    * Add any additional collectors and analyzers that should only by included in support bundles and not in preflight checks.

   **Example**:

   In the example below, the support bundle spec is created in a defined template named `troubleshoot.supportBundle`. This spec also adds the logs collector (which is recommended for all support bundles) and the deploymentStatus analyzer.
    
   ```yaml
   {{- define "troubleshoot.supportBundle" -}}
   apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
   kind: SupportBundle
   metadata:
     name: {{ include "common.names.name" . }}-support-bundle
   spec:
     # Use {{ include }} to include the shared collectors
     # Use nindent to ensure correct YAML spacing
     collectors: {{- include "troubleshoot.collectors.shared" .  | nindent 4 }}
     # Add any support bundle-only collectors
       - logs:
           name: app/replicated/logs
           selectors: 
             - app.kubernetes.io/name=replicated
             - app.kubernetes.io/={{ .Release.Name }}
           limits:
             maxAge: 720h
       - logs:
           name: app/{{ include "common.names.name" . }}/logs
           selectors: {{- include "common.labels.matchLabels" . | nindent 10 }}
           limits:
             maxAge: 720h
     # Use {{ include }} to include the shared analyzers       
     analyzers: {{- include "troubleshoot.analyzers.shared" .  | nindent 4 }}
     # Add any support bundle-only analyzers
       - deploymentStatus:
           name: replicated
           outcomes:
             - fail:
                 when: "absent" # note that the "absent" failure state must be listed first if used.
                 message: The replicated deployment is not present.
             - fail:
                 when: "< 1"
                 message: The replicated deployment does not have any ready replicas.
             - warn:
                 when: "< 1"
                 message: The replicated deployment has less than the required number of replicas.
             - warn:
                 when: "= 1"
                 message: The replicated deployment has only a single ready replica.
             - pass:
                 message: There are multiple replicas of the replicated deployment ready.
   {{- end -}}
   ```

1. In a new YAML file, create the preflight spec (`apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2` and `kind: Preflight`) in another defined template.

   **Example**:

   The example below defines a template named `troubleshoot.preflights`.

   ```yaml
   {{- define "troubleshoot.preflights" -}}
   apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
   kind: Preflight
   metadata:
     name: {{ include "common.names.name" . }}-preflight
   spec:
     collectors: {{- include "troubleshoot.collectors.shared" .  | nindent 4 }}
     analyzers: {{- include "troubleshoot.analyzers.shared" .  | nindent 4 }}
   {{- end -}}
   ```
   :::note
   It is less likely that have any collectors and analyzers that are unique to preflights and excluded from your support bundles.
   :::

1. Finally, add the specs to Kubernetes Secrets. This allows the specs in the cluster to be discovered so that end users can run preflights and generate support bundles.

    **Example:**

    In the example below, the `"troubleshoot.preflights"` and `"troubleshoot.supportBundle"` templates are included in two different Secrets as string data. When these Secrets are templated, the collectors and analyzers defined in each spec (including the shared collectors and analyzers) are rendered.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: {{ include "common.names.name" . }}-preflight
      labels: {{- include "common.labels.standard" . | nindent 4 }}
        troubleshoot.sh/kind: preflight
    stringData:
      preflight.yaml: |- {{- include "troubleshoot.preflights" . | nindent 4 }}
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: {{ include "common.names.name" . }}-support-bundle
      labels: {{- include "common.labels.standard" . | nindent 4 }}
        troubleshoot.sh/kind: support-bundle
    stringData:
      support-bundle-spec: |- {{- include "troubleshoot.supportBundle" . | nindent 4 }}
    ```

1. Package your Helm chart to a `.tgz` chart archive and add the archive to a new release to test your changes.
