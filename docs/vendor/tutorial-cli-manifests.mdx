# Step 3: Get the Sample Manifests

To create a release with the replicated CLI, you must have the YAML manifest files for the application in a directory.
This step shows you how to download sample manifest files from https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated-starter-kots and initialize a Git repository for the application.

To get the sample manifest files and initialize the application repository:

1. Run the following command to create and change to a directory for your project:

  ```
  mkdir replicated-cli-tutorial
  cd replicated-cli-tutorial
  ```

1. Run the following command to make a `/manifests` directory for the application manifests and download the starter YAML from https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated-starter-kots:

  ```
  mkdir ./manifests
  curl -fSsL https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots-default-yaml/archive/v2020-09-03.tar.gz | \
    tar xzv --strip-components=1 -C ./manifests \
    --exclude README.md --exclude LICENSE --exclude .gitignore
  ```

1. Run the following command to verify that you can see the YAML files in the `replicated-cli-tutorial/manifests` folder:

  ```
  ls manifests/
  ```

  In the ouput, you can see the following files:

  ```
  config-map.yaml     deployment.yaml     preflight.yaml      service.yaml
  config.yaml         ingress.yaml        replicated-app.yaml support-bundle.yaml
  ```

1. Run the following `release lint` command to verify this YAML:

  ```
  replicated release lint --yaml-dir=manifests
  ```

  If there are no errors, an empty list is displayed with a zero exit code:

  ```text
  RULE    TYPE    FILENAME    LINE    MESSAGE
  ```

  For a complete list of the possible error, warning, and informational messages that can appear in the ouput of the `release lint` command, see [KOTS Lint Rules](/reference/kots-lint).

1. Initialize this project as a Git repository so that you can track your history.
Additionally, the replicated CLI reads git metadata to help with the generation of release metadata,
such as version labels. More information about this is covered later in this tutorial.

  To initialize the repository, run the following commands:

  ```shell script
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial Commit: CLI Quickstart"
