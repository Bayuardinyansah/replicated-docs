Replicated recommends that you use custom domains to alias Replicated endpoints. Replicated domains are external to your domain and can require additional security reviews by your customer. Using custom domains as aliases can bring the domains inside an existing security review and reduce your exposure.

For more information, see [Using Custom Domains](/vendor/custom-domains-using).
