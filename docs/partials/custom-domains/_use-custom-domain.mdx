After you add one or more custom domains to the vendor portal, you can use a custom domain by setting it as the default or by assigning it to an individual release channel.

### Set a Default Domain

When you set a Replicated registry or proxy service custom domain as the default, it is used by default for all new releases promoted to any channel, as long as the channel does not have a different domain assigned in its channel settings.

Setting a default domain is useful for ensuring that the same domain is used across channels for all your customers.

Only releases that are promoted to a channel _after_ you set a default domain use the new default domain. Any existing releases that were promoted before you set the default continue to use the same domain that they used previously.

To set a custom domain as the default:

1. In the vendor portal, go to **Custom Domains**.

1. Next to the target domain, click **Set as default**.

1. In the confirmation dialog that opens, click **Yes, set as default**.

### Assign a Domain to a Channel {#channel-domain}

You can assign a domain to an individual channel by editing the channel settings. When you assign a domain to a channel, new releases promoted to the channel use the selected domain rather than any default domains.

Assigning a domain to a release channel is useful when:

* You need to override a default domain for a specific channel, such as if you need to use a different domain for releases promoted to your Beta and Stable channels.
* You need to test a domain in a development environment before you set the domain as the default for all customers.

To assign a custom domain to a channel:

1. In the vendor portal, go to **Channels** and click the settings icon for the target channel.

1. Under **Custom domain overrides**, in the drop-down for the target Replicated endpoint, select the domain to use for the channel. Select **No override** to use the default custom domain, or to use the default Replicated domain if not default custom domain is set.
