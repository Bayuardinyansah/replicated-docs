# Introduction and Setup

<TutorialIntro/>

The steps in this CLI-based tutorial show you how to use the replicated CLI to create and promote releases for your application. The replicated CLI is the CLI for the Replicated vendor portal. You can use the replicated CLI as a software vendor to programmatically create, configure, and manage your application artifacts, including application releases, release channels, customer entitlements, private image registries, and more.

For a tutorial that demonstrates how to use the Replicated vendor portal to create and promote releases for your application, see [UI Tutorial](tutorial-ui-setup).

## Set Up the Environment

As part of this tutorial, you install a sample application onto a Kubernetes cluster.

Before you begin, create a Kubernetes cluster that you can access with the kubectl command line tool.

For example, to create a cluster in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), run the following command in the gcloud CLI:
```
gcloud container clusters create NAME --preemptible --no-enable-ip-alias
```
Where `NAME` is any name for the cluster.
