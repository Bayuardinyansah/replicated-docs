# Step 9: Update the Application

To install and test this new release, you must connect to the admin console on port :8800 using a web browser.
At this point, the UI likely shows that your test application is up-to-date and that no updates are available.
The admin console can be configured to check for new updates at regular intervals, but for now you will trigger a check manually.

To check for updates:

1. Click **Check for Updates** on the Version History page.
  You should see a new release in the history now. You can click **Diff versions** to review the differences.

1. Click **Deploy** to apply the new YAML, which changes the number of NGINX replicas. The deployment only takes a few seconds.

1. On your test server, run the following command to verify the deployment:

  ```
  kubectl get pods
  ```

  You should see two NGINX pods running.

  **Example output**:

  ```
  NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  example-nginx-67f4f5dd7-6wjff        1/1     Running   0          12s
  example-nginx-67f4f5dd7-gtqpp        1/1     Running   0          34m
  kotsadm-759486cc77-hcp8r             1/1     Running   0          100m
  kotsadm-rqlite-0                     1/1     Running   0          100m
  kurl-proxy-kotsadm-697fc4bff-ccjhz   1/1     Running   0          100m
  ```

## Next Steps

You can iterate further on your application. Continue making changes and using `replicated release create --auto` to publish them. You can add `-y` to the command to skip the prompt.

To learn more about the app manager features, you can explore some of the tutorials and packaging options, such as:

* Integrating with a CI/CD platform. See [Tutorial: Integrating with an existing CI/CD platform](tutorial-ci-cd-integration).
* Packaging an application from a Helm chart. See [About Packaging with Helm](helm-overview).

If you already have a release published in the vendor portal that you want to use as a starting point, run the following command to access the help docs for `replicated release download`:

```shell script
replicated release download --help
```
