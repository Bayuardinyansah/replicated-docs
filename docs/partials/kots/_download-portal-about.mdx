The Replicated download portal can be used to share license files and air gap bundles with customers. A unique download portal link is available for each customer. The download portal makes the relevant installation files available for download based on the customer's license, such as:
* The customer's license file
* `.airgap` bundles for the application releases that the customer has access to based on their channel assignment
* The Replicated KOTS admin console `kotsadm.tar.gz` air gap bundle
* The Replicated kURL `.tgz` air gap bundle
* Preflight, support bundle, and kots CLI kubectl plugins

The most common use case for the download portal is for customers installing into air gap environments who must download both their license file as well as multiple air gap bundles. In this case, the download portal makes it easy for customers to find and download the correct KOTS admin console or kURL air gap bundle based on the selected application version to ensure compatibility.
