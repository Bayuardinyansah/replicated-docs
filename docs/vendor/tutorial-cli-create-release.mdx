# Step 4: Create a Release

Now that you have some YAML manifest files, you can create a release and promote it to the Unstable channel for internal testing.

To create and promote a release:

1. Run the following command to verify this YAML:

  ```
  replicated release lint --yaml-dir=manifests
  ```

  If there are no errors, an empty list is displayed with a zero exit code:

  ```text
  RULE    TYPE    FILENAME    LINE    MESSAGE
  ```

  For a complete list of the possible error, warning, and informational messages that can appear in the ouput of the `release lint` command, see [KOTS Lint Rules](/reference/kots-lint).

1. Initialize the project as a Git repository so that you can track your history.
Additionally, the replicated CLI reads git metadata to help with the generation of release metadata,
such as version labels. More information about this is covered later in this tutorial.

  To initialize the repository, run the following commands:

  ```shell script
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial Commit: CLI Tutorial"

1. Run the following command with the `--auto` flag to generate release notes and metadata based on the Git status:

  ```shell script
  $ replicated release create --auto
  ```

  **Example output:**

  ```

    Prepared to create release with defaults:

        yaml-dir        "./manifests"
        promote         "Unstable"
        version         "Unstable-ba710e5"
        release-notes   "CLI release of master triggered by exampleusername [SHA: d4173a4] [31 Oct 22 08:51 MDT]"
        ensure-channel  true
        lint-release    true

    Create with these properties? [Y/n]
  ```

1. Type `y` and press Enter to confirm the prompt:

  **Example output:**

  ```text
    • Reading manifests from ./manifests ✓
    • Creating Release ✓
      • SEQUENCE: 1
    • Promoting ✓
      • Channel VEr0nhJBBUdaWpPvOIK-SOryKZEwa3Mg successfully set to release 1
  ```
  The release is created and promoted.

1. Run the following command to verify that the release was created:

  ```text
  $ replicated release ls
  ```
  **Example output:**

  ```text
  SEQUENCE    CREATED                 EDITED                  ACTIVE_CHANNELS
  1           2022-10-31T14:55:35Z    0001-01-01T00:00:00Z    Unstable
  ```
