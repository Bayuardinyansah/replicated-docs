= Configuring backups

The KOTS Snapshots feature is a backup and restore option that lets you define a manifest for executing snapshots and restoring previous snapshots.

. To enable snapshots:

.. Add a backup resource to the application using the Velero manifest. The following minimal YAML example enables Snapshots in the application. When a snapshot is executed in the admin console or by a schedule, Snapshots will include all annotated volumes in the archive (see the additional information on annotating volumes later in this task).
+
.Example
[source,YAML]
----

apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: backup
spec: {}

----

.. Optional: Configure the [optional resources](/vendor/packaging/include-resources/) annotation in the manifest so that it can be dynamically enabled based on a license field or a config option.
+
NOTE: If you are using multiple applications, each application should have a [backup resource](/reference/v1beta1/backup/) in each application's manifest so that each application can be included in the [Full Snapshot](/kotsadm/snapshots/overview/#full-snapshots-recommended) backup.

. Configure a backup for any volumes that require backup. By default, no volumes are included in the backup. If any pods mount a volume that should be backed up, you must configure the backup with an annotation listing the specific volumes to include in the snapshot.
+
The annotation name is `backup.velero.io/backup-volumes` and the value is a comma separated list of volumes to include in the backup.
+
For example, in the following deployment, `pvc-volume` is the only volume that is backed up. The `scratch` volume is not included in the backup because it is not listed in annotation on the pod spec.
+
[source,YAML]
----

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sample
  labels:
    app: foo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: foo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: foo
      annotations:
        backup.velero.io/backup-volumes: pvc-volume
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver
        name: test-webserver
        volumeMounts:
        - name: pvc-volume
          mountPath: /volume-1
        - name: scratch
          mountPath: /volume-2
      volumes:
      - name: pvc-volume
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: test-volume-claim
      - name: scratch
        emptyDir: {}

----

. Optional: Configure manifest exclusions. By default, Velero also includes snapshots of all of the Kubernetes objects in the namespace. To exclude any manifest, add a `velero.io/exclude-from-backup` label to the manifest to be excluded.
+
.Example
+
[source,YAML]

----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: sample
  labels:
    velero.io/exclude-from-backup: "true"
stringData:
  uri: Secret To Not Include
