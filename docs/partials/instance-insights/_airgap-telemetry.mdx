To gather telemetry from air gap instances, the vendor portal analyzes archived event files contained in customer-generated support bundles. When support bundles from air gap environments are uploaded to the vendor portal, these event files are processed and associated with the correct customer and instance ID. The vendor portal then updates the insights and event data for the instance accordingly.
