The Replicated collab GitHub repository is used for tracking and collaborating on escalations, bug reports, and feature requests that are sent by members of a vendor portal team to the Replicated team. Members of a vendor portal team submit issues to the collab repository through the vendor portal [Support](vendor.replicated.com/support) page. Replicated creates a unique collab repository in GitHub for each vendor portal team.
