Verify that both the `REPLICATED_API_TOKEN` environment variable that you exported when you installed the replicated CLI and the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable are set correctly:

```
replicated release ls
```

In the output of this command, you see either a list of existing releases or an empty list of releases if this is your first application with Replicated.
