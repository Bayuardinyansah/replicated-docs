To complete this tutorial, you must have _one_ of the following:

* A Kubernetes cluster that you can access using the kubectl command line tool.
* A VM that meets the following requirements:
  * Ubuntu 18.04
  * At least 8 GB of RAM
  * 4 CPU cores
  * At least 40GB of disk space

  You can create the VM on any cloud provider, or use a locally-provisioned VM.

:::note
Replicated also offers a series of beginner, intermediate, and advanced labs that automatically provision the required environment. To complete labs in a sandbox environment rather than provisioning a Kubernetes cluster or a VM, see [Deploy a Hello World Application with Replicated](https://play.instruqt.com/replicated/tracks/hello-world).
