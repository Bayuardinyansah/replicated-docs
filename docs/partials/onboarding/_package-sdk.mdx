In your application Helm chart `Chart.yaml` file, add the YAML below to declare the SDK as a dependency. If your application is installed as multiple charts, declare the SDK as a dependency of the chart that customers install first. Do not declare the SDK in more than one chart. For more information, see [Packaging a Helm Chart for a Release](helm-install-release).
