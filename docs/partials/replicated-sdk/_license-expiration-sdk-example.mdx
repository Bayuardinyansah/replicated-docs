You can use the Replicated SDK API `/api/v1/license/fields/{field_name}` endpoint to revoke a customer's access to your application during runtime when their license file expires.

To revoke access to your application when a license expires:

1. In the vendor portal, click **Customers**. Select the target customer and click the **Customer details** tab. Alternatively, click **+ Create customer** to create a new customer.

1. Under **Expiration policy**:

   1. Enable **Customer's license has an expiration date**.

   1. For **When does this customer expire?**, use the calendar to set an expiration date for the license.

1. In your application, use the `/api/v1/license/fields/expires_at` endpoint to get the `expires_at` field that you defined in the previous step.

    ```bash
    curl replicated:3000/api/v1/license/fields/expires_at
    ```

    **Example response**:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "expires_at",
      "title": "Expiration",
      "description": "License Expiration",
      "value": "2023-05-30T00:00:00Z",
      "valueType": "String",
      "signature": {
        "v1": "c6rsImpilJhW0eK+Kk37jeRQvBpvWgJeXK2M..."
      }
    }
    ```

1. Add logic to your application to revoke access if the current date and time matches the expiration date of the license.

1. Use signature verification in your application to ensure the integrity of the license field. See [Verifying License Field Signatures](licenses-verify-fields-sdk-api).

1. To test your changes, create a new release and promote it to a development channel, such as Unstable. Install the release in a development environment using the license ID for the customer that you created or edited.
