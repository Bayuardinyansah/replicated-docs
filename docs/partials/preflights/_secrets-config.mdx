Replicated recommends writing your preflight checks specification in one or more Secrets. Using Secrets protects secure information in a cluster.

:::note
Alternatively, you can use a ConfigMap (`kind: configMap`) if the specification will not collect private information from the cluster.
:::

Create a Secret as a YAML file with `kind: Secret` and add a basic preflight specification.
