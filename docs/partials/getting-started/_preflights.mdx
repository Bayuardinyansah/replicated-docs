To define preflight checks:

1. In your Helm chart `templates` directory, add a Kubernetes Secret that includes a preflight spec. For more information, see:
    * [Defining Preflight Checks](/vendor/preflight-defining)
    * [Tutorial: Add Preflight Checks to a Helm Chart](/vendor/tutorial-preflight-helm-setup)

1. Update dependencies and package the chart as a `.tgz` file:

   <HelmPackage/>

1. Add the `.tgz` file to a new release. For more information, see [Managing Releases with the Vendor Portal](releases-creating-releases) or [Managing Releases with the CLI](releases-creating-cli).

1. <TestYourChanges/>

    Preflight checks run automatically during installation.

1. Continue to create and test new releases with additional preflight checks until you are ready to move on to the next task.
