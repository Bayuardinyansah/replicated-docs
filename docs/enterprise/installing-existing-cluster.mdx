# Online Installation in Existing Clusters

<IntroExisting/>

## Prerequisites

Complete the following prerequisites:

<PrereqsExistingCluster/> 
<LicenseFile/>

## Install KOTS {#online}

This procedure describes how to install KOTS in your existing cluster.

<KotsAbout/>

To install KOTS:

1. Run one of these commands to install the Replicated KOTS CLI and KOTS. As part of the command, you also specify a name and version for the application that you will install as part of the [Install and Deploy the Application](#install-app) procedure that follows.

    * **For the latest application version**:
    
      ```shell
      curl https://kots.io/install | bash
      kubectl kots install APP_NAME
      ``` 
    * **For a specific application version**:

      ```shell
      curl https://kots.io/install | bash
      kubectl kots install APP_NAME --app-version-label=VERSION_LABEL
      ```

    Replace, where applicable:
    
    <AppNameUI/>
  
    * `VERSION_LABEL` with the label for the version of the application to install. For example, `--app-version-label=3.0.1`.  

    **Examples:**

    ```shell
    curl https://kots.io/install | bash
    kubectl kots install application-name
    ``` 

    ```shell
    curl https://kots.io/install | bash
    kubectl kots install application-name --app-version-label=3.0.1
    ```

## Install and Deploy the Application {#install-app} 

<AppInstallIntroOnline/>

To install the application using the Admin Console:

1. Access the Admin Console on port 8800. If the port forward is active, go to [http://localhost:8800](http://localhost:8800) to access the Admin Console.

      If you need to reopen the port forward to the Admin Console, run the following command:

      ```shell
      kubectl kots admin-console -n NAMESPACE
      ```
      Replace `NAMESPACE` with the namespace where KOTS is installed.

1. Log in with the password that you created during installation.
  
1. Upload your license file.

1. If there are configurations specific to the application, complete the fields on the configuration screen then click **Continue**. The required and optional configuration fields on this screen are used to build the final deployable Kubernetes manifests for the application.

   If the application vendor did not include any configuration options for the application, this screen does not display.

1. Complete the preflight checks. KOTS automatically runs preflight checks (conformance tests) against the target namespace and cluster to ensure that the environment meets the minimum requirements to support the application.

   * If there are no preflight check warnings or failures, continue with deployment.
   * If there are any preflight check warnings and failures:
      * Resolve the warnings and failures, and click **Re-run** to run the preflight checks again.
      * If there are no failures that prevent application deployment, you can choose to dismiss the preflight check warnings to continue.
        :::note
        Replicated recommends that you address any warnings or failures, rather than dismissing them. Preflight checks help ensure that your environment meets the requirements for application deployment.
        :::
      * If you are installing with minimal role-based access control (RBAC), KOTS recognizes if the preflight checks failed due to insufficient privileges.

        When this occurs, a kubectl CLI preflight command displays that lets you manually run the preflight checks. The Admin Console automatically displays the results of the preflight checks.

   After preflight checks are complete, KOTS deploys the Admin Console and the application, and the Admin Console dashboard opens:
