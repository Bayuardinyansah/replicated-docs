To deploy Helm charts, KOTS requires a HelmChart custom resource for each Helm chart that you add to a release. You configure the HelmChart custom resource to provide the necessary instructions to KOTS for processing and preparing the chart for deployment. The HelmChart custom resource also maps values to the `values.yaml` file in the Helm chart. For example, you can use the HelmChart custom resource to map user-provided configuration settings from the Replicated admin console Config page to values in your Helm chart.
