# Submitting a Support Request

You can submit a support request with or without a support bundle using the Replicated vendor portal. Uploading a support bundle is secure and helps the Replicated support team troubleshoot your application faster.

If you or your customer are unable to generate a support bundle, you can submit the request without a support bundle and the support team will assist you.

For more information about how to generate a support bundle using either the Replicated admin console or the kubectl CLI, see [Troubleshooting an Application](https://docs.replicated.com/enterprise/troubleshooting-an-app).

To submit a support request:

1. From the [vendor portal](https://vendor.replicated.com), click **Support** in the upper right corner of the page.

  The Vendor Support page opens.

1. Click **Submit a Support Request**.

  The Support Request dialog opens.

1. In section 1, complete the fields with information about your issue.

1. In section 2, do _one_ of the following actions:

    - Use your pre-selected support bundle from the pick list
    - Select **Upload and attach a new support bundle**
    - Select **I'm unable to generate a support bundle**

1. Click **Submit Support Request**.

  :::note
  Click **Back** to exit without submitting a support request.
