# Installing with Embedded Cluster (Beta)

This topic describes how to install with Replicated Embedded Cluster in an online (internet-connected) environment.

## Prerequisites

* Download the Embedded Cluster binary and your license.

## Install

To install an application with Embedded Cluster:

1. SSH onto the machine where you will install the application.

1. Ensure that the Embedded Cluster binary and the license are available in the working directory.

1. Install the application:

    ```
    sudo ./APP_SLUG install --license LICENSE_FILE
    ```
    Where:
    * `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug for the application.
    * `LICENSE_FILE` is the customer's license.

1. Enter an Admin Console password when prompted.

    The Admin Console URL is printed when the installation finishes. Access the Admin Console to begin installing your application. In the Admin Console, you can add nodes if you want a multi-node cluster. Then, you can provide application config, run preflights, and deploy your application.
