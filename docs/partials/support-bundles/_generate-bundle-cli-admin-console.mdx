If the Replicated admin console is running and the application is installed, log in to the admin console to get the CLI command for generating a support bundle.

To generate a support bundle with the CLI:

1. Log in to the admin console and go to the **Troubleshoot** tab.

1. On the Troubleshoot page, at the bottom of the Support Bundles section, click the **If you'd prefer, click here to get a command to manually generate a support bundle** link to get the command to generate a support bundle.

  The command includes customizations provided by your application vendor.

1. Run the command provided in the admin console to generate a support bundle:

  ```
  kubectl support-bundle secret/NAMESPACE/kotsadm-APP_SLUG-supportbundle --redactors=configmap/NAMESPACE/kotsadm-redact-spec/redact-spec,configmap/NAMESPACE/kotsadm-APP_SLUG-redact-spec/redact-spec
  ```

  Replace:
  - `NAMESPACE` with the name of the namespace.
  - `APP_SLUG` with the unique application slug.
