# Generating Support Bundles

This topic describes how to generate support bundles in existing clusters using the kubectl support-bundle plugin.

## Overview

You can use the open-source support-bundle kubectl plugin to generate support bundles for an application. For more information, see [Collecting a Support Bundle](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/support-bundle/collecting/) in the Troubleshoot documentation.

## Prerequisite: Install the support-bundle Plugin

<InstallPlugin/>

## Generate a Bundle

<GenerateBundle/>

## Generate a Bundle when a Helm Installation Fails

If a Helm installation fails and you want to collect a support bundle to assist with diagnostics, you can use a Replicated default specification to generate the support bundle.

Run the following command:

```bash
kubectl support-bundle https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot-specs/main/in-cluster/default.yaml
```
