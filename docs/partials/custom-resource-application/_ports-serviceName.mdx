<li><code>ports.serviceName</code>: The name of the service that receives the traffic. KOTS can create a port forward to ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer services. For embedded clusters provisioned by Replicated kURL, NodePort type services are recommended because the service is exposed on the host where it is accessible to users. For more information about Kubernetes service types, see <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">Service</a> in the Kubernetes documentation.</li>
