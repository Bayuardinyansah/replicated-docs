# Port Forwarding Services with KOTS

This topic describes how to add one or more ports to the Replicated KOTS port forward tunnel by configuring the `ports` key in the KOTS Application custom resource.

The information in this topic applies to existing cluster installations. For information about exposing services for Replicated kURL or Replicated Embedded Cluster installations, see [Exposing Services Using NodePorts](kurl-nodeport-services).

## Overview

For installations into existing clusters, KOTS automatically creates a port forward tunnel and exposes the Admin Console on port 8800 where it can be accessed by users. In addition to the 8800 Admin Console port, you can optionally add one or more extra ports to the port forward tunnel so that users installing in exsting clusters can easily access your application at installation. For example, you can:
* List the primary application ports to provide one or more links directly to the application 
* List the ports for internal services, such as application admin controls and other services that are not exposed to all users

Port forwarding a service with KOTS can be useful if you want to provide users a way to access your application without requiring them to set up cluster ingress, add a load balancer, create firewall rules, and/or provide an IP address or hostname at the time of installation. This makes it easier for the person or process installing the application to verify that the application is running.

## Port Forward a Service with the KOTS Application `ports` Key

To port forward a service with KOTS for existing cluster installations:

1. In a new release, configure the [`ports`](/reference/custom-resource-application#ports) key in the KOTS Application custom resource with details for the target service. For example:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
   kind: Application
   metadata:
     name: my-application
   spec:
     ports:
       - serviceName: my-service
         servicePort: 3000
         localPort: 8888
   ```

   1. For `ports.serviceName`, add the name of the service. KOTS can create a port forward to ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer services. For more information about Kubernetes service types, see [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) in the Kubernetes documentation.
   
   1. For `ports.servicePort`, add the `containerPort` of the Pod where the service is running. This is the port where KOTS forwards traffic.

      <ServicePortNote/>

   1. For `ports.localPort` add the port to map on the local workstation.

1. Promote the release to the channel that you use for internal testing, then install in a development environment to test your changes.

    When the application is in a Ready state and the KOTS port forward is running, you will see output similar to the following:

    ```bash
    • Press Ctrl+C to exit
    • Go to http://localhost:8800 to access the Admin Console
    • Go to http://localhost:8888 to access the application
    ```
    Confirm that you can access the service at the URL provided in the KOTS CLI output.

1. (Optional) Add a link to the service on the Admin Console dashboard. See [Add a Link to a Port-Forwarded Service on the Admin Console Dashboard](#add-link) below.

## Add a Link to a Port-Forwarded Service on the Admin Console Dashboard {#add-link}

After you add a service to the KOTS port forward tunnel, you can configure the Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource to add a link to the port-forwarded service on the Admin Console dashboard. This allows users to access the service from the Admin Console UI.

To add a link to a port-forwarded service on the Admin Console dashboard:

1. In a new release, open the KOTS Application custom resource and add a URL to the `ports.applicationURL` field. For example:

    ```yaml
   apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
   kind: Application
   metadata:
     name: my-application
   spec:
     ports:
       - serviceName: my-service
         servicePort: 3000
         localPort: 8888
         applicationUrl: "http://my-service"
   ```

    Consider the following guidelines for this URL:
      * Use HTTP instead of HTTPS unless TLS termination takes place in the application Pod.
      * You can use the name of the service as the hostname for the URL. For example, `http://my-service`. KOTS rewrites the URL with the hostname in the browser during deployment.

1. Add a Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource in the release. For example:

    ```yaml
    # app.k8s.io/v1beta1 Application Custom resource

    apiVersion: app.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Application
    metadata:
      name: "my-application"
    spec:
      descriptor:
        links:
          - description: Open App
            # url matches ports.applicationURL in the KOTS Application custom resource
            url: "http://my-service"
    ```

    1. For `spec.descriptor.links.description`, add the link text that will appear on the Admin Console dashboard. For example, `Open App`.

    1. For `spec.descriptor.links.url`, add the _same_ URL that you used in the `ports.applicationURL` in the KOTS Application custom resource.

1. Promote the release to the channel that you use for internal testing, then install in a development environment to test your changes.

   When the application is in a Ready state, confirm that you can access the service by clicking the link that appears on the dashboard. For example:

   <img alt="Admin Console dashboard with Open App link" src="/images/gitea-open-app.png" width="700px"/>

## Access Port-Forwarded Services

This section describes how users can access port-forwarded services.

### Command Line

Users can run [`kubectl kots admin-console`](/reference/kots-cli-admin-console-index) to open the KOTS port forward tunnel.

The `kots admin-console` command runs the equivalent of `kubectl port-forward svc/myapplication-service <local-port>:<remote-port>`, then prints a message with the URLs where the user can access the Admin Console and any port-forwarded services. For more information about the `kubectl port-forward` command, see [port-forward](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#port-forward) in the Kubernetes documentation.

For example:

```bash
kubectl kots admin-console --namespace gitea
```
```bash
• Press Ctrl+C to exit
• Go to http://localhost:8800 to access the Admin Console
• Go to http://localhost:8888 to access the application
```

### Admin Console

You can optionally add a link to a port-forwarded service from the Admin Console dashboard. This requires additional configuration. For more information, see [Add a Link to a Port-Forwarded Service on the Admin Console Dashboard](#add-link).

The following example shows an **Open App** link on the dashboard of the Admin Console for an application named Gitea:

<img alt="Admin Console dashboard with Open App link" src="/images/gitea-open-app.png" width="700px"/>

## Example: Bitnami Gitea Helm Chart with LoadBalancer Service

This example uses a KOTS Application custom resource and a Kubernetes SIG Application custom resource to configure port forwarding for the Bitnami Gitea Helm chart in existing cluster installations, and add a link to the port-forwarded service on the Admin Console dashboard. To view the Gitea Helm chart source, see [bitnami/gitea](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/main/bitnami/gitea) in GitHub.

To test this example:

1. Pull version 1.0.6 of the Gitea Helm chart from Bitnami:

    ```
    helm pull oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/gitea --version 1.0.6
    ```

1. Add the `gitea-1.0.6.tgz` chart archive to a new, empty release in the Vendor Portal along with the `kots-app.yaml`, `k8s-app.yaml`, and `gitea.yaml` files provided below. Promote to the channel that you use for internal testing. For more information, see [Managing Releases with the Vendor Portal](releases-creating-releases).

1. Install the release to confirm that the service was port-forwarded successfully. To test the port forward, click **Open App** on the Admin Console dashboard after the application reaches a Ready state.
