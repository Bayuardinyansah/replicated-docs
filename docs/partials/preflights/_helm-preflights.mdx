If your application uses Helm charts, you can support preflight checks for any installation type (Helm, KOTS, kURL) directly from the Helm chart. Preflights specified in the Helm chart override the `kind: Preflight` custom resource used by KOTS. If KOTS cannot find preflights specified in the Helm chart archive, then KOTS searches for `kind: Preflight` in the root of the release.
