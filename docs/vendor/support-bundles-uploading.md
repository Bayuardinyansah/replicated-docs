# Uploading a Support Bundle to Replicated Support

Support bundles help the Replicated support team troubleshoot your application faster. The best practice is to use the Replicated vendor portal to upload the bundle securely.

In the vendor portal, there are two options to upload a support bundle to the Replicated Support Team. You can:

- Submit a support request with the uploaded bundle.
- Share the bundle with Replicated without opening a support ticket.
