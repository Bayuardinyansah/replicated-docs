<NotificationsAbout/>

You can receive notifications about customer insights through a team Slack channel. You can also receive individual notifications from an instance through email or in-application.

## Configure Slack Notifications for Instances

Slack notifications must be enabled for a Slack channel before you can turn on notifications for an instance. For more information about Team enablement, see [Configuring Slack Notifications](team-management-slack-config).

To configure Slack notifications for an instance:

1. Go to **Applications > Customers**, and click an instance under a customer that you want to receive notifications for.

    <img src="/images/customer-instances.png" alt="Customer instances list in the vendor portal" width="600"/>

1. On the Instance Details page, click **Slack Notifications**. From the dropdown list select one of the following options:

    - **App status:** Sends notifications for status changes only to the Slack channel.
    - **All changes:** Sends notifications for all changes to the Slack channel.
    - **Ignore:** Turns off notifications to the Slack channel.

1. Repeat these steps for every instance that you want to receive Slack notifications for.

## Configure Email Notifications

To configure email notifications for an instance:

1. Go to **Applications > Customers**, and click an instance under a customer that you want to receive notifications for.
