# Step 5: Install the Release on a VM

Next, get the customer-specific embedded cluster installation commands and then install the release on a Linux VM.

To install the release with embedded cluster:

1. In the [vendor portal](https://vendor.replicated.com), go to **Customers**. Click on the name of the customer you created.

1. Click **Install instructions > Embedded cluster**. The **Embedded cluster install instructions** dialog opens.

1. On the command line, SSH onto your Linux VM.

1. Run the first command in the **Embedded cluster install instructions** dialog to download the release.

1. Run the second command in the dialog to extract the release:

    ```bash
    tar -xvzf $REPLICATED_APP-unstable.tgz
    ```

1. Run the third command to install the release:

    ```bash
    sudo ./$REPLICATED_APP install --license license.yaml
    ```

1. When prompted, enter a password for accessing the KOTS admin console.

    The installation command takes a few minutes to complete.

1. When the installation command completes, go to the URL provided in the output to log in to the admin console.

    **Example output:**

    ```bash
    ✔  Host files materialized
    ? Enter an Admin Console password: ********
    ? Confirm password: ********
    ✔  Node installation finished
    ✔  Storage is ready!
    ✔  Embedded Cluster Operator is ready!
    ✔  Velero is ready!
    ✔  Admin Console is ready!
    ✔  Finished!
    Visit the admin console to configure and install gitea: http://104.155.145.60:30000
    ```

    At this point, the cluster is provisioned and the KOTS admin console is deployed, but the application is not yet installed.

1. Bypass the browser TLS warning by clicking the URL provided to proceed.

1. Click **Advanced > Proceed**

1. On the **HTTPS for the Gitea admin console** page, select **Self-signed** and click **Continue**.

1. On the login page, enter the password that you created during installation.

1. On the **Nodes** page, you can view details about the VM where you installed, including its node role, status, CPU, and memory. Users can also optionally add additional nodes on this page before deploying the application. Click **Continue**. 

    The admin console dashboard opens.
    
    
1. In the **Version** section, for version `0.1.0`, click **Deploy**. The application status changes from Missing to Unavailable while the `gitea` Deployment is being created.

1. After a few minutes when the application status is Ready, click **Open App** to view the Gitea application in a browser:

1. Go to the **Cluster Management** tab to see the same nodes information that was displayed during installation. Users can manage cluster nodes.     

## Next Step

Install the same release with the Helm CLI. See [Step 7: View Instance Reporting Data](tutorial-embedded-cluster-reporting).
