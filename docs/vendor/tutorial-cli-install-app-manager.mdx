# Step 6: Install the App Manager

The next step is to test the installation process for the application release that you promoted. Using the kots CLI, you can install the Replicated app manager and deploy the application in your Kubernetes cluster using just one command with some additional flags.

The _app manager_ is the Replicated component that allows your users to install, manage, and upgrade your application. Users can interact with the app manager through a user interface, called the Replicated admin console, or through a CLI, called the kots CLI.

To install the app manager and deploy the application:

1. Run the following command to get the installation commands for the Unstable channel, where you promoted the release for the `cli-tutorial` application:

    ```
    replicated channel inspect Unstable
    ```

    **Example output:**

    ```
    ID:             2GmYFUFzj8JOSLYw0jAKKJKFua8
    NAME:           Unstable
    DESCRIPTION:
    RELEASE:        1
    VERSION:        Unstable-d4173a4
    EXISTING:

        curl -fsSL https://kots.io/install | bash
        kubectl kots install cli-tutorial/unstable

    EMBEDDED:

        curl -fsSL https://k8s.kurl.sh/cli-tutorial-unstable | sudo bash

    AIRGAP:

        curl -fSL -o cli-tutorial-unstable.tar.gz https://k8s.kurl.sh/bundle/cli-tutorial-unstable.tar.gz
        # ... scp or sneakernet cli-tutorial-unstable.tar.gz to airgapped machine, then
        tar xvf cli-tutorial-unstable.tar.gz
        sudo bash ./install.sh airgap
    ```
    This command prints information about the channel, including the commands for installing in:
    * An existing cluster
    * An _embedded_ cluster created by the Replicated Kubernetes installer
    * An air gap cluster that is not connected to the Internet

1. If you have not already, configure kubectl access to the cluster you provisioned as part of [Set Up the Environment](tutorial-cli-setup#set-up-the-environment). For more information about setting the context for kubectl, see [Command line tool (kubectl)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

1. Run the existing cluster installation script from above with the following changes to deploy the admin console and application at the same time you install the app manager. In this step, the license file uploads and the preflight checks run as part of the deployment:

  ```
  curl -fsSL https://kots.io/install | bash
  kubectl kots install cli-tutorial/unstable \
  --license-file ./LICENSE_YAML \
  --shared-password PASSWORD \
  --namespace NAMESPACE_NAME
  --no-port-forward
  ```

  Replace:

    - LICENSE_YAML with the local path to your license file
    - PASSWORD with a password that will be used to access the admin console.
    - NAMESPACE_NAME with a name for the namespace where the app manager will be installed. Replicated recommends using `default` for this value.

  When the admin console is ready, the script prints the `https://localhost:8800` URL where you can access the admin console and the `http://localhost:8888` URL where you can access the application. You will use this information in [Step 7: Edit the Config Screen](tutorial-cli-app-deploy).

   **Example output**:

   ```
  • Go to Deploying Admin Console
    • Creating namespace ✓
    • Waiting for datastore to be ready ✓
  • Waiting for Admin Console to be ready ✓
  • Waiting for installation to complete ✓
  • Waiting for preflight checks to complete ✓

  • Press Ctrl+C to exit
  • Go to http://localhost:8800 to access the Admin Console

  • Go to http://localhost:8888 to access the application
   ```

 :::note
 If you enable port forwarding, the kots CLI output includes an IP address as part of the URLs to access the application and the admin console. For more information about each of the flags for the `kots install` command, see [install](/reference/kots-cli-install) in the kots CLI documentation.

## Next Step

Continue to [Step 7: Edit the Config Screen for the Application](tutorial-cli-deploy-app) to log in to the admin console and make changes to the Config screen.
