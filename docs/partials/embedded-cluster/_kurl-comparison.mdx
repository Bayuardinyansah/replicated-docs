Embedded cluster is a successor to Replicated kURL. Compared to kURL, embedded cluster offers several improvements such as:
* Significantly faster installation, updates, and node joins
* A redesigned admin console UI for managing the cluster
* Improved support for multi-node clusters
* One-click updates that update both the application and the cluster at the same time
