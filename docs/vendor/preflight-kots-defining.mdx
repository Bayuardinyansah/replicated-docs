# Define Preflight Checks for KOTS

You define preflight checks based on your application needs. Preflight checks are not included by default. This procedure provides a basic understanding and some key considerations to help guide you.

For more information about defining preflight checks, see [Preflight Checks](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/preflight/introduction/), [Collecting Data](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/collect/), and [Analyzing Data](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/analyze/) in the Troubleshoot documentation. For basic examples of checking CPU, memory, and disk capacity, see [Node Resources Analyzer](https://troubleshoot.sh/reference/analyzers/node-resources/) in the Troubleshoot documentation.

To define preflight checks:

1. Create a Preflight custom resource manifest file (`kind: Preflight`) in your release.

      ```yaml
      apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
      kind: Preflight
      metadata:
         name: collectors
      spec:
         collectors: []
     ```
1. <PreflightsAddCollectors/>

1. <PreflightsAddAnalyzers/>

1. <PreflightsAddStrict/>

1. Add the manifest files to the application that you are packaging and distributing with Replicated.

1. Save and promote the release to a development environment to test your changes.
