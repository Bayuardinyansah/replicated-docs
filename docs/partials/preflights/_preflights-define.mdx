Any preflight checks you run are dependent on your application needs. This section gives some guidance about how to think about using collectors and analyzers to design preflight checks. For more information about defining preflight checks, see [Collecting Data](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/collect/)
and [Analyzing Data](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/analyze/) in the Troubleshoot documentation.

For more examples, see the [Troubleshoot example repository](https://github.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot/tree/main/examples/preflight) in GitHub.
