The Replicated download portal can be used to share license files, air gap bundles, and other assets with customers. A unique download portal link is available for each customer. The download portal makes the relevant assets available for download based on the customer's license, such as:
* The customer's license file
* `.airgap` bundles for the application releases that the customer has access to based on their channel assignment
* The Replicated KOTS admin console `kotsadm.tar.gz` air gap bundle
* The Replicated kURL `.tgz` air gap bundle
* Preflight, support bundle, and kots CLI kubectl plugins
