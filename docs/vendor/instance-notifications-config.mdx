# Configure Notifications

<NotificationsAbout/>

You can receive notifications about customer insights through a team Slack channel. You can also receive individual notifications from an instance through email or in-application.

## Configure Slack Notifications for Instances

Slack notifications must be enabled for a Slack channel before you can turn on notifications for an instance. For more information about Team enablement, see [Configuring Slack Notifications](team-management-slack-config).

To configure Slack notifications for an instance:

1. Go to **Applications > Customers**, and click an instance under a customer that you want to receive notifications for.

    <img src="/images/customer-instances.png" alt="Customer instances list in the vendor portal" width="600"/>

1. On the Instance Details page, click **Slack Notifications**. From the dropdown list, select one of the following options:

    - **App status:** Sends notifications for critical application status changes only to the Slack channel.
    - **All changes:** Sends notifications for all changes to the Slack channel.
    - **Ignore:** Turns off notifications to the Slack channel.

1. Repeat these steps for every instance that you want to receive Slack notifications for.



## Configure Email and In-App Notifications

You can subscribe to email and in-app notifications that display in your view of the vendor portal.

To configure email notifications and in-app notification for an instance:

1. Go to **Applications > Customers**, and click an instance under a customer that you want to receive notifications for.

    <img src="/images/customer-instances.png" alt="Customer instances list in the vendor portal" width="600"/>

1. On the Instance Details page, click **My Notifications**.

1. On the Instance Details page, click **My Notifications**. From the dropdown list, select one of the following options:

    - **App status:** Sends notifications for critical application status changes only to the Slack channel.
    - **All changes:** Sends notifications for all changes to the Slack channel.
    - **Ignore:** Turns off notifications to the Slack channel.

1. Repeat these steps for every instance that you want to receive Slack notifications for.


## Test Notifications Are Working

After you enable notifications for a running development instance, test that your notifications are working as expected.

Do this by forcing your application into a non-ready state. For example, you can delete one or more application Pods and wait for a Replication controller to recreate them.

Then look for notifications:

- In the assigned Slack channel
- As an event stream on the **Instance details** page

:::note
There is a 30-second buffer between event detection and notifications being sent. This buffer provides better roll-ups and reduces noise.

## View Details and Manage Subscriptions

You can manage the notifications that you are subscribed to. This includes:

- Viewing details about an instance and drilling down to see the instance details, a bundle, or the release that triggered the notification.
- Unsubscribing from an instance notification completely. This can be useful when you are no longer responsible for monitoring a specific customer instance and want to remove all activity.
- Changing the level of participation or frequency of an instance notifications. For example, if you only want to be notified in certain circumstances, such as when you are @mentioned.

To view details and manage notifications:

1. In the vendor portal, go to your **Account Settings** page.

1. From the left menu, click **Notifications**.

    The **Notifications** page displays the list of notifications you received.
