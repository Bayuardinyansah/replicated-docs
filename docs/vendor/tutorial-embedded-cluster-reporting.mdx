# Step 6: View Instance Reporting Data

The Replicated SDK automatically sends reporting data back to the vendor portal for instances installed in onnline environments.

To view reporting data for the instance that you installed:

1. Open the [vendor portal](https://vendor.replicated.com/) and go to **Customers**. Select the customer that you created.

    On the **Reporting** page for the customer, you can see details about the customer's license and installed instances:

1. On the **Reporting** page, under **Instances**, click on the instance that you just installed to open the instance details page.

    On the instance details page, you can see additional insights such as the cluster where the application is installed, the version of KOTS running in the cluster, instance status and uptime, and more:
