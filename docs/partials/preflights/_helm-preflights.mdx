If your application uses Helm charts, you can define preflight checks for any installation type (Helm, KOTS, kURL) directly from the Helm chart. Preflights specified in the Helm chart override the Preflight custom resource used by KOTS. During installation, if KOTS cannot find preflights specified in the Helm chart archive, then KOTS searches for `kind: Preflight` in the root of the release.
