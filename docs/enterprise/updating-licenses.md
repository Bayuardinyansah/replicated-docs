## Upgrade from a Community License

If you have a community license, you can change your license by uploading a new one. This allows you to upgrade from a community version of the software without having to reinstall the Admin Console and the application.

To change a community license to another license:

1. In the **License** tab of the Admin Console, click **Change license**.
1. In the dialog, upload the new license file.
