If you installed in an embedded cluster with Replicated kURL and your software vendor included the Velero add-on in the kURL specification, then Velero was automatically installed with default internal storage for backups.

After confirming that Velero is already installed in your embedded cluster, Replicated recommends that you proceed to change the default internal storage because it is insufficient for disaster recovery. See [Updating Storage Settings in the Admin Console](snapshots-updating-with-admin-console).
