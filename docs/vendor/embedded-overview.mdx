# About Embedded Cluster (Beta)

This topic describes how to use the Replicated Embedded Cluster to configure, install, and manage your application in an embedded Kubernetes cluster.

:::note
Embedded cluster is in beta. If you are instead looking for information about creating Kubernetes Installers with Replicated kURL, see the [Replicated kURL](/vendor/packaging-embedded-kubernetes) section.

## Requirements

## Limitations

Embedded cluster has the following limitations:

* **Multi-node support is in alpha**: You can create multi-node embedded clusters, but this feature is in alpha. Only single-node embedded clusters are in beta.

* **No migration from kURL**: There is not yet a way to migrate a kURL instance to Embedded Cluster. We intend to build a migration or upgrade for kURL instances. There are many ways that this could be built, each with various tradeoffs.

* **Cannot change `spec.api` and `spec.storage` after installation**: The `spec.api` and `spec.storage` keys in the k0s config cannot be changed after installation. Whereas most keys in the k0s config apply to the whole cluster, these two keys are set for each node. Embedded cluster cannot update these keys on each individual node during updates, so they cannot be changed after installation.

* **GitOps workflow not supported**: Embedded Cluster does not support using the GitOps workflow. We do not intend to support the GitOps workflow for Embedded Cluster in the future. If an end-user is interested in GitOps, consider the Helm install method instead.

## Known Issues

The following known issues exist:

* When a customer instance fetches a new version of your application, the version is rendered by the currently deployed version of KOTS. If your new application version uses functionality that the currently deployed version of KOTS doesn't support, your application version will not be rendered and cannot be upgraded to. In the interim, we are limiting new functionality introduced in KOTS that could trigger this issue, and we are working on a solution.
