# Online Installation using a Kubernetes Installer

This topic explains how to install an application on an embedded cluster provisioned by the Replicated Kubernetes installer.

<KurlAbout/>

## About High Availability Mode

Online installations can use high availability (HA) mode with the Kubernetes installer.

## Prerequisites

Complete the following prerequisites:

<PrereqsEmbeddedCluster/>

<HaLoadBalancerPrereq/>
    

## Install the Application {#online}

This procedure explains how to install the the application in an online environment, with and without high availability mode.

To install the application:

1. Run one of the following commands:

    * For the latest version of the application:

      ```bash
      curl -sSL https://k8s.kurl.sh/APP_SLUG | sudo bash
      ```

    * For a specific version of the application, use the `app-version-label` flag and the version label for a particular version of your vendor's application:

      ```shell
      curl https://k8s.kurl.sh/APP_SLUG | sudo bash -s app-version-label=VERSION_LABEL
      ```
    
    * For high availability mode:

      ```bash
      curl -sSL https://k8s.kurl.sh/APP_SLUG | sudo bash -s ha
        ```
    
    Replace, where applicable:
     * `APP_SLUG` with the unique slug for the application. The application slug is included in the installation command provided by the vendor.
     * `VERSION_LABEL` with the label for the version of the application to install. For example, `--app-version-label=3.0.1`.

1. (High Availability Only) If you did not preconfigure a load balancer, you are prompted during the installation. Do one of the following:

    - If you are using the internal load balancer, leave the prompt blank and proceed with the installation.

    - If you are using an external load balancer, pass the load balancer address.

1. Note the `Kotsadm` and `Login with password (will not be shown again)` fields in the output of the installation command. 

1. Log in to the admin console to complete the application setup, run preflight checks, and deploy. See [Completing Application Setup and Deploying](installing-app-setup).

## Next Step

(Optional) You can add nodes to the cluster. See [Adding Nodes to Kubernetes Installer Clusters](cluster-management-add-nodes).
