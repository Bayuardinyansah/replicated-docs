# Step 4: Create a Customer

After promoting the first release for the application, create a customer so that you can install the application.

A _customer_ is an object in the vendor portal that represents a single licensed user of your application. When you create a customer, you define entitlement information for the user. In order to install your application, your users must be associated with a customer in the vendor portal.

To create a customer:

1. In the vendor portal, click **Customer > Create customer**.

1. For **Customer name**, add a name.

1. For **Channel**, select **Unstable**. This allows the customer to install releases promoted to the Unstable channel.

1. For **Customer email**, enter an email address. An email address is required for Helm installations to authenticate with the Replicated registry. This email address is never used to send emails to customers.

1. Click **Save Changes**.
