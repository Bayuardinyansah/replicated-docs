# Performing Updates in kURL Clusters

This topic describes how to perform updates in Replicated kURL installations. It includes procedures for updating an application, as well as for updating the versions of Kubernetes, Replicated KOTS, and add-ons in a kURL cluster.

## Update an Application

For kURL installations, you can update an application from the Admin Console. You can also set up automatic updates. See [Configuring Automatic Updates](/enterprise/updating-apps).

### Online Environments

<AdminConsole/>

### Air Gap Environments

<AdminConsoleAirGap/>

## Update the kURL Cluster

You can rerun the kURL installation script to update a kURL cluster. For more information about kURL cluster udpates, see [About kURL Cluster Updates](/enterprise/updating-kurl-about).

:::important
The Kubernetes scheduler automatically reschedules Pods to other nodes during maintenance. Any deployments or StatefulSets with a single replica experience downtime while being rescheduled.
:::

### Online Environments

To update the kURL cluster in an online environment:

1. Run the kURL installation script on any primary node in the cluster:

   ```
   curl -sSL https://k8s.kurl.sh/APP_SLUG | sudo bash -s ADVANCED_OPTIONS
   ```
   Replace:
   * `APP_SLUG` with the unique slug for the application from your application vendor.
   * `ADVANCED_OPTIONS` optionally with any flags listed in [Advanced Options](https://kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/advanced-options) in the kURL documentation.
      
     To use no advanced installation options, remove `-s ADVANCED_OPTIONS` from the command.

     See the following recommendations for advanced options:

      <InstallerRequirements/>

1. <UpgradePrompt/>

### Air Gap Environments

For air gap installations, you must load images on each node in the cluster before you can run the installation script to update Kubernetes and any add-ons. This is because upgraded components might have Pods scheduled on any node in the cluster. 

To update the kURL cluster in an air gap environment:

1. On each node in the cluster, download the kURL `.tar.gz` bundle provided by your software vendor and extract the contents:

   ```bash
   tar -xvzf FILENAME.tar.gz
   ```
   Replace `FILENAME` with the name of the kURL `.tar.gz` bundle.

   For more information, see [Download the kURL Bundle](/vendor/releases-download-airgap-bundles#installer-bundle) in _Downloading Air Gap Bundles_.

1. Run the following KURL script to ensure all required images are available:

   ```
   cat tasks.sh | sudo bash -s load-images
   ```

   :::note
   The kURL installation script that you run in the next step also performs a check for required images and prompts you to run the `load-images` command if any images are missing.
   :::

1. Run the kURL installation script on any primary node in the cluster with the `airgap` option:

   ```
   cat install.sh -s airgap OTHER_ADVANCED_OPTIONS
   ```
   Replace `OTHER_ADVANCED_OPTIONS` optionally with any flags listed in [Advanced Options](https://kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/advanced-options) in the kURL documentation.
   
     See the following recommendations for advanced options:
      <InstallerRequirements/>

1. <UpgradePrompt/>
   
   :::note
   If Kubernetes must be upgraded by more than one minor version, the script automatically searches for the required Kubernetes assets in the `/var/lib/kurl/assets/` directory. If the assets are not available, the script prints a command to download the assets as a `tar.gz` package. Download and provide the absolute path to the package when prompted to continue with the upgrade.
