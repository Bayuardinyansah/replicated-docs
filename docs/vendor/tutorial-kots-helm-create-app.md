# Step 2: Create an Application

Create an application in the Replicated vendor portal. An _application_ is an object that has its own customers, channels, releases, license fields, and more.

A single team can have more than one application. It is common for teams to have multiple applications for the purpose of onboarding, testing, and iterating.

To create an application:

1. Log in to the [vendor portal](https://vendor.replicated.com/).

1. In the top left of the page, open the application drop down and click **Create new app...**.

   <img alt="create new app drop down" src="/images/create-new-app.png" width="300px"/>

   <img alt="create new app page" src="/images/create-application-page.png" width="500px"/>
