# Step 6: Install the App Manager

After you create and download a customer license, get the installation commands so that you can test the installation on a development server.
In this case, we demonstrate an installation without an existing cluster, on a single virtual machine (VM). This type of installation is known as an embedded or Kubernetes installer-created cluster.

To install the app manager:

1. Run the following command to get the installation commands for the Unstable channel:

    ```text
    $ replicated channel inspect Unstable
    ```

    **Example output:**
    ```
    ID:             VEr0nhJBBUdaWpPaOIK-SOryKZEwa3Mg
    NAME:           Unstable
    DESCRIPTION:
    RELEASE:        1
    VERSION:        Unstable-ba710e5
    EXISTING:

        curl -fsSL https://kots.io/install | bash
        kubectl kots install cli-quickstart/unstable

    EMBEDDED:

        curl -fsSL https://k8s.kurl.sh/cli-quickstart-unstable | sudo bash

    AIRGAP:

        curl -fSL -o cli-quickstart-unstable.tar.gz https://k8s.kurl.sh/bundle/cli-quickstart-unstable.tar.gz
        # ... scp or sneakernet cli-quickstart-unstable.tar.gz to airgapped machine, then
        tar xvf cli-quickstart-unstable.tar.gz
        sudo bash ./install.sh airgap
    ```

    The output generates commands for installing on an [existing cluster](../enterprise/installing-general-requirements#existing-cluster-requirements), installing [without an existing cluster](../enterprise/installing-general-requirements#embedded-cluster-requirements), and installing on an [air gap cluster](../enterprise/installing-existing-cluster#air-gap).

1. Use SSH to access the VM that you created as part of [Set Up the Environment](tutorial-cli-setup#set-up-the-environment).

1. On the VM, run the installation script from above, using the `EMBEDDED` version:

  ```shell
  curl -sSL https://kurl.sh/<your-app-name-and-channel> | sudo bash
  ```

  This script installs Docker, Kubernetes, and the Replicated admin console containers (kotsadm).

  Installation takes approximately 5-10 minutes.

  After the script completes the initial installation, the output displays the connection URL and password that you must use in a later step of the installation process:

  ```text

  Kotsadm: http://[ip-address]:8800
  Login with password (will not be shown again): [password]
  ```

1. Reload your shell using the following command to access the cluster with `kubectl`:

    ```
    bash -l
    ```

    The UIs of Prometheus, Grafana and Alertmanager have been exposed on NodePorts 30900, 30902 and 30903 respectively.

1. Use the generated user:password of admin:[password] to access Grafana.

1. Run the following script on your other nodes to add worker nodes to this installation:

    ```
    curl -sSL https://kurl.sh/cli-quickstart-unstable/join.sh | sudo bash -s kubernetes-master-address=[ip-address]:6443 kubeadm-token=[token] kubeadm-token-ca-hash=sha256:[sha] kubernetes-version=1.16.4 docker-registry-ip=[ip-address]
      ```

1. Reload the shell, following the instructions on the screen, to make `kubectl` work:

    ```bash
    user@kots-guide:~$ kubectl get pods
    ```
    **Example output:**
    ```
    NAME                                  READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
    kotsadm-585579b884-v4s8m              1/1     Running     0          4m47s
    kotsadm-migrations                    0/1     Completed   2          4m47s

    user@kots-guide:~$
    ```
