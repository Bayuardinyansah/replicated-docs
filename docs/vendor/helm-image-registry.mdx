# Using External Private Registries for Helm Installations (Beta)

This topic describes the steps required to connect to an external private registry for installations with Helm.

## Overview

If your application images are available in a private image registry exposed to the Internet, such as Docker Hub or Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), then the unique customer licenses that you create for your application can grant proxy, or _pull-through_, access to the assignee without exposing registry credentials to your customer.

To grant access to an external private registry for Helm installations, you can use the Replicated SDK and the Replicated proxy service. When you include the Replicated SDK with your Helm chart application, a `global.replicated.dockerconfigjson` field is automatically injected in the Helm chart values after customers provide their license ID during installation. The `global.replicated.dockerconfigjson` field contains a base64 encoded Docker configuration file that you can use to create a pull secret for accessing your private images through the proxy service at `proxy.replicated.com`.

For more information about the Replicated SDK, see [About the Replicated SDK (Beta)](replicated-sdk-overview).

For information about how Kubernetes uses the `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` Secret type to authenticate to a private image registry, see [Pull an Image from a Private Registry](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

## Prerequisites

* Declare the Replicated SDK as a dependency in your Helm chart. See [Using the SDK With Your Application (Beta)](replicated-sdk-using).
* Provide read-only credentials for the external private registry in your Replicated account. This allows Replicated to access the images through the proxy service. See [Configure Access to an External Registry](packaging-private-images#configure-access-to-an-external-registry) in _Connecting to an Image Registry_.
* (Optional) To use a custom domain for the proxy service instead of `proxy.replicated.com`, see [Using Custom Domains for the Replicated Registry and Proxy Service](custom-domains).
## Deliver Image Pull Secrets for the Proxy Service

This procedure shows how to create an image pull secret for the proxy service and then override your private registry URL during installation to use `proxy.replicated.com` instead.

To use an external registry and the proxy service for Helm installations:

1. In your Helm chart templates, create a Kubernetes Secret to evaluate if the `global.replicated.dockerconfigjson` value is set, and then write the rendered value into a Secret on the cluster:

   ```yaml
   # /templates/replicated-pull-secret.yaml

   {{ if .Values.global.replicated.dockerconfigjson }}
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: replicated-pull-secret
   type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
   data:
     .dockerconfigjson: {{ .Values.global.replicated.dockerconfigjson }}
   {{ end }}
   ```

  <NameLimitation/>

1. Ensure that you have a field in your Helm chart values file for your image repository URL, and that any references to the image in your Helm chart access the field from your values file.  

   **Example**:

   ```yaml
   # values.yaml
   ...
   images:
     myapp:
       # Add image URL in the values file
       apiImageRepository: quay.io/my-org/api
       apiImageTag: v1.0.1
   ```
   ```yaml
   # /templates/deployment.yaml

   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
    name: example
   spec:
     template:
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: api
             # Access the apiImageRepository field from the values file
             image: {{ .Values.images.myapp.apiImageRepository }}:{{ .Values.images.myapp.apiImageTag }}
   ```

1. In your Helm chart templates, add the `replicated` image pull secret that you created to any manifests that reference the private image:

   ```yaml
   # /templates/example.yaml
   ...
   {{ if .Values.global.replicated.dockerconfigjson }}
   imagePullSecrets:
     - name: replicated-pull-secret
   {{ end }}
   ```

   <NameLimitation/>

   **Example:**

    ```yaml
    # /templates/deployment.yaml
    ...
    image: "{{ .Values.images.myapp.apiImageRepository }}:{{ .Values.images.myapp.apiImageTag }}"
    {{ if .Values.global.replicated.dockerconfigjson }}
    imagePullSecrets:
      - name: replicated-pull-secret
    {{ end }}
    name: myapp
    ports:
    - containerPort: 3000
      name: http
    ```

1. Package your Helm chart and add it to a release. Promote the release to a development channel. See [Managing Releases with Vendor Portal](releases-creating-releases).

1. Install the chart in a development environment to test your changes:

   1. Create a local `values.yaml` file to override the default external registry image URL with the URL for the image on `proxy.replicated.com`.
   
      The proxy service URL has the following format: `proxy.replicated.com/proxy/APP_SLUG/EXTERNAL_REGISTRY_IMAGE_URL`
      
      Where:
      * `APP_SLUG` is the slug of your Replicated application.
      * `EXTERNAL_REGISTRY_IMAGE_URL` is the path to the private image on your external registry.

      **Example**
      ```yaml
      # A local values.yaml file
      ...
      images:
        myapp:
          apiImageRepository: proxy.replicated.com/proxy/my-app/quay.io/my-org/api
          apiImageTag: v1.0.1

      ```

      :::note
      If you configured a custom domain for the proxy service, use the custom domain instead of `proxy.replicated.com`. For more information, see [Using Custom Domains for the Replicated Registry and Proxy Service](custom-domains).
      :::
   
   1. Log in to the Replicated registry and install the chart, passing the local `values.yaml` file you created with the `--values` flag. See [Installing an Application with Helm (Beta)](install-with-helm).
