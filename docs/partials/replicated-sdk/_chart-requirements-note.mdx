If your chart uses the Chart API version 1 (v1), then add the dependency to the `requirements.yaml` file rather than the `Chart.yaml` file. For more information, see [Consolidation of requirements.yaml into Chart.yaml](https://helm.sh/docs/faq/changes_since_helm2/#consolidation-of-requirementsyaml-into-chartyaml) in the Helm documentation.
