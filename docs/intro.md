# Welcome to Replicated Documentation

This topic provides an introduction to Replicated as well as information about
how to navigate the Replicated product documentation.

## What is Replicated?

Replicated allows software vendors to securely distribute their application to
diverse customer environments, including both on-premises and cloud environments.

Replicated packages the vendor's application using a set of Kubernetes manifests
and installs the application onto a Kubernetes cluster in the customer's environment.

For more information about Replicated features, see [About Replicated](replicated-about).
